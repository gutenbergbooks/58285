    <div>NEWS FROM THE NORTH</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Corinne twisted and turned before the
mirror over the console table, flicked a speck
of powder from her sacque and stood back
to regard herself appreciatively. She felt her
toilette to be extremely distinguished when war deprivations
were taken into account.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m ready,” she drawled, addressing her cousin.
“If we-all don’t want to be late we might as well
start. It’s ’most train-time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot settled back in her chair and began to
rock furiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think I’ll go to the dêpot to-day,” she
said finally.</p>

<p class='c012'>Corinne looked at her indignantly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What did you let me take all the trouble to
powder my nose for then?” she demanded. “You
know ma won’t let me go alone in that crowd, and
there’s sure to be some news.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, bother the news!” Harriot murmured
under her breath, unconsciously turning her head
to look in the direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Harriot May!” cried Corinne disapprovingly,
“you speak as if you didn’t care about the victories
of our great Confederacy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But they aren’t always victories,” Harriot returned
bluntly. “That’s the trouble. We’re just
as apt to hear that the hateful Yankees have beaten
us again and—and besides, I’d rather stay here,
anyhow.” Once more she turned an eye toward
the cooking-quarters and sniffed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re not thinking of eating again?” Corinne
demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I am,” Harriot answered blandly. “Aunt
Decent’s going to make corn meal poundcake and
if we hang ’round the kitchen she’ll bake us each a
little patty-pan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re such a child,” Corinne said, with the
patronizing smile fifteen bestows upon twelve; but if
she expected Harriot to resent her grown-up airs
she must have been disappointed. The “child” suddenly
jumped to her feet as a faint odor of baking
drifted into the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on, Corinne!” she insisted, “Aunt Decent
is taking the first pan out of the oven now. Besides,
I’ll coax her to give us some cush to feed
Saretta’s baby. She’s sure to be there after clabber.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Corinne followed, still protesting; but cakes were
not so plentiful in the South during this, the second
year of the war, that even a girl who preferred to
think herself very much of a young lady could afford
to scorn them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, the train’s always late anyway,” she murmured
indulgently, as if in excuse for letting her
cousin have her own way.</p>

<p class='c012'>Led by Harriot the two went toward the kitchen
by a circuitous route as if they had just happened
to pass by. Outside the door was a group of
colored mothers and orphan-tenders, awaiting the
special rations which were doled out to little babies,
and among them was Saretta with Aunt Decent’s
newest grandchild in her arms. Harriot, wise in
the management of the dusky autocrat, said nothing
of patty-pans until she had stuffed the baby. Then
she broached the subject tentatively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Land sakes, but you is the eatin’est child!” Aunt
Decent exclaimed heartily, and that was sufficient assurance
that there would be a special portion of the
coveted poundcake for the two girls.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish I had gone over to the Polks. Cousin
Sally would have walked to the dêpot with me,”
Corinne hinted with conscious cunning. Harriot,
who had no other cousins in Georgia, was decidedly
jealous of Corinne’s many relatives.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll go to the dêpot with you now,” Harriot said
good-naturedly. “Not that I care anything about
your old train,” she added, as they started off.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Its arrival is the only thing that ever happens
in this stupid little town,” Corinne snapped.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maybe,” Harriot agreed, “but how any one can
enjoy seeing a crowd of ladies in black silk Talmas
covered with dust, is more than I can understand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are the wounded officers,” Corinne suggested,
a trifle self-consciously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, all trying to look interesting,” Harriot
answered, with more than a trace of scorn in her
tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Corinne regarded her askance for a moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What in the world has come over you to-day?”
she asked. “That’s no way to speak of our heroes.
If you weren’t my very own cousin—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I am,” Harriot interrupted, “and I’m
just as much for the South as any one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“More so than some, I hope,” Corinne interrupted
in her turn.</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot stopped short in her tracks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you say a word about mother being a Submissionist,
I’ll never speak to you again,” she threatened
seriously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wasn’t going to mention Aunt Parthenia,”
Corinne asserted, but the younger girl shook her
head as if she were not so sure of this.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just because mother didn’t think we should have
seceded doesn’t make her a traitor to the South,”
she continued earnestly. “Besides, April is rebel
enough for a whole family.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The girls walked on again in silence. They had
touched upon a delicate subject, and Corinne, with
unusual good sense, held her tongue until they
reached the railroad shed where the expected train
was just coming to a stop.</p>

<p class='c012'>A large crowd had already gathered to hear the
latest news of the outside world. Because the mails
were seriously interrupted and few newspapers were
published in the South, the people of the towns and
villages were almost wholly dependent upon the information
to be picked up from travelers; so, for
miles about the little town of Washington, Georgia,
the inhabitants of the district drove or rode in to
meet the daily train.</p>

<p class='c012'>This particular afternoon there was an unusually
large crowd clustered around the wheezy engine with
its string of shabby coaches.</p>

<p class='c012'>“More wounded,” Harriot whispered, nodding
toward a number of flat cars attached to the end
of the train.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think so,” Corinne answered, a little excitedly.
“They’re filled with ladies and gentlemen,
and there’s something going on. Lets get
closer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They elbowed their way through the press until
they came within earshot of a Confederate officer,
who was speaking to the assemblage. His arm was
in a sling and over his shoulders he had a faded
blanket shawl which, with his threadbare gray uniform,
gave him a most dilapidated appearance. But
his audience, well used to the sight of ragged soldiers,
listened with marked attention to his words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It has as much force as a soap-bubble,” the officer
was saying as the girls came within sound of
his voice. “Just suppose Abe Lincoln took it into
his head that it was wrong to keep birds in cages.
And then suppose he issued a proclamation to France
ordering her to open all her cage doors and let out
the birds. Does anybody think France would pay
any attention to it? Of course not! They would
insist, first of all, that the birds would starve if they
were let out. Secondly, they would say it was none
of Lincoln’s business and, lastly, they would know,
just as we know, that the birds don’t want their
freedom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What has Abe Lincoln to do with French
birds?” Harriot whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hush!” Corinne admonished her, straining her
ears to catch the next words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, my friends,” the officer went on, “that’s
the way it is with this Emancipation Proclamation.
You know, and I know, that our servants don’t want
to be free. They wouldn’t know what to do with
freedom if they had it—and it’s none of Abe
Lincoln’s business anyway! What authority has he
over our great Confederacy? Not that much!”
and he snapped his fingers with a fine gesture of indifference.
“No more than he has over France.
For two years he has been trying to beat us and
now, ladies and gentlemen, he’s getting desperate.
This proclamation is his last move to scare us. He
knows at last that Cotton is King. And, let me tell
you, the Knights of the Golden Circle are not idle.
The North is about ready to give up. This proclamation
doesn’t amount—”</p>

<p class='c012'>The train gave a jerk and, starting off, put an end
to his oratory. The crowd cheered as the passenger
cars moved slowly away to carry the news to the
next stopping-place along the line.</p>

<p class='c012'>But there was a lack of heartiness in the shouts
of applause, and a rather silent group of people hurried
toward their homes. Men looked at each other
with sober faces and shook their heads somewhat
doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m going straight back to ma,” said Corinne,
as the two girls turned to retrace their steps.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the patty-pans!” Harriot exclaimed.
“They’ll be done by the time we get home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Save mine till to-morrow,” Corinne answered.
“Ma’s sure to want to talk to Aunt Parthenia in
the morning, and I’ll come over with her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Stewarts and the Mays lived at opposite ends
of the town so that the girls separated immediately.
Harriot, thinking of corn meal poundcake, hurried
to the cook-house. Perhaps because she feared to
be tempted, she put Corinne’s portion out of sight
at once, then munching her own share, went in search
of her mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had not been at all impressed by the harangue
she had heard at the station. That sort of speech-making
was no new thing to her, and she had failed
wholly to grasp the significance of what the Confederate
officer had said. Nevertheless she knew
that her mother would be interested in any news
arriving by the train and was ready enough to report
what she had heard.</p>

<p class='c012'>The town house of the May family was a spacious
building. On one side of a wide hall were the
parlors. On the other were the breakfast and state
dining-rooms. Back of these were various offices
for the administration of the estates. At each end
of the dining-room, looms for homespun had been
set up; for the many slaves, both in town and on the
plantations, had to be clothed as well as fed. It was
here that Mrs. May spent the greater portion of her
days at this time of year. The spinning-wheels humming
made an accompaniment to the clang of the
battens; and several old colored women, wearing gay
bandanas, bent their heads over a basket of cotton
which had just been brought in. Aunt Decent’s
daughter Isabel was busily carding and near the
great fire-place Jim’s Jimmy was standing. It was
his business to keep the fire going, and the heat made
the child so drowsy that he was not allowed to sit
down, for fear he would fall sound asleep and tumble
into the flames.</p>

<p class='c012'>As Harriot entered the room, Mrs. May stepped
back and forth following her thread before the loom,
with a slow grace that brought to mind pictures of
stately minuets that might have been danced in years
past upon the very floor over which she moved so
lightly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re just in time, my dear,” she called, catching
sight of Harriot. “I need some one to reel
thread into hanks for me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot set to work willingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve just come back from the dêpot,” she began,
once the task was well started. “There were a lot
of people there to-day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What news did you hear?” asked Mrs. May.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, nothing much,” Harriot replied. “There
was an officer made a speech about birds in cages
and freedom and France. He was wounded in the
arm, but people didn’t seem to care about what he
said. At least they didn’t cheer nearly as much as
I’ve heard sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Was it about the fighting?” Mrs. May’s tone
was anxious, for she had both a husband and a son
in the Confederate army.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” drawled Harriot, “it wasn’t interesting.
It was all about old Abe Lincoln and a Proclam—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Harriot,” Mrs. May interrupted abruptly, “suppose
you run upstairs to April and see if you can’t
help her with her hair. She’s to take supper at Pettigrew’s.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But mother,” Harriot began, surprised at this
unusual request.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Run along, honey,” her mother insisted. “And
send Merry down to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Somewhat puzzled, Harriot left the busy room and
ran to the floor above, entering her sister’s chamber
without ceremony to find April standing, slight, fair
and very beautiful, while her brown maid, Merry,
laced her stays. Her wonderful blond hair had already
been woven into an intricate crown, and, at
sight of it, Harriot flopped into a chair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mother wants Merry,” she announced. “Don’t
ask me why, ’cause I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>April regarded her young sister for a moment
without speaking.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mother said I was to help with your hair. I
knew you wouldn’t let me touch your precious yellow
wig,” Harriot went on. “But it wasn’t a bit of use
my telling her that. I suppose I might just as well
go down again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If mother sent you up here, you’d better stay,”
April remarked knowingly. “Merry can go as soon
as I’m laced.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right,” agreed the good-natured Harriot,
“though I don’t see why—. Mammy says you’ll
have a red nose ‘sho’ as you’he bohn’ if you wear
your things so tight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And she says you won’t have ‘a toof in yoh haid’
if you eat so much poundcake,” April retorted with
a laugh. “You can go down to Old Miss, Merry,”
she added to the maid.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the door had hardly closed upon Merry when
April turned a serious face to her sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What were you blabbing that made mother send
you up here?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot was genuinely surprised and injured.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not one earthly thing,” she declared stoutly.
“Corinne and I went to the dêpot to hear the news
and I had just begun to tell mother about it. I didn’t
say a thing in the world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is the news?” April inquired anxiously.
“Has Rosecrans—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I tell you I didn’t hear a thing about the war,”
Harriot insisted, much aggrieved. “If I had, it isn’t
a crime to mention it, is it? Besides, I’d only begun
when mother sent me up to you. There was a man
talking about Abe Lincoln and a proclamation, letting
the birds free or something. I didn’t understand
much of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What have Abe Lincoln’s proclamation to do
with us?” said April sharply, more to herself than
to her sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that moment Mrs. May came into the room,
closing the door carefully behind her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have no doubt the proclamation is the promised
emancipation of the slaves, honey,” she suggested
quietly, having overheard April’s question.
“I didn’t wish it mentioned before the women downstairs.
There is no use unsettling the quarters yet.
But they’ll learn of it fast enough; for, from now on,
the negroes are free.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mother!” exclaimed April passionately, “how
can you say such things? What does the South
care for Lincoln’s proclamation? And as for the
slaves—they’ll do as they’re bid. They know they
can’t escape the hounds just because a miserable
Yankee says they’re free.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May looked at her beautiful daughter in silence
for a moment, shaking her head gently. When
she spoke it was with a note of sadness in her voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It hurts me to hear you talk like that, my child,
even though I know you don’t mean it. You are no
more capable of sending the hounds after one of our
people than I am.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, well, our servants will never leave us,” April
replied with deep conviction. “What difference
does this proclamation make to us? Mr. Davis is
the President of our country, not Abe Lincoln.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m afraid you don’t understand, dear,” Mrs.
May replied patiently. “As I see it, this proclamation
gives the Confederacy its death-blow. England,
which has been seizing slave ships and fighting slavery
for many years, cannot side with the South in
this war when slavery is made the open issue. Without
her aid what shall we do? You know how short
we are already of necessities. If England refuses
to supply us, how can we go on?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but, mother, we must beat them,” April
cried. “We shall find a way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Honey,” Mrs. May went on earnestly, “I want
to prepare you for what is coming. Remember how
rapidly our resources are dwindling and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our soldiers are the bravest in the world,” April
broke in vehemently. “The Yankees can never beat
them!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That may be true,” her mother admitted, “but
they cannot fight without powder for their guns.
Think of the shifts we are already put to. Your
father has just written me to have the smoke-house
floor dug up and boiled for the salt that may be obtained.
There is talk of sacrificing the tobacco crop
to get the niter in it. Wool is so precious that it is
against the law to kill a sheep—and look!” she
went on, holding out her slender hands stained with
dyes. “In order to barely clothe our people I must
work as I never expected to in my life. Of that I do
not complain, but do you not see that this cannot go
on indefinitely? For a year or two we may manage
to exist; but the end is certain. I want you to realize
it, my child.”</p>

<p class='c012'>April trembled for a moment and then with a
brave toss of her head she lifted her eyes to her
mother’s.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m going to a party and I shan’t cry,” she insisted,
struggling with the emotions that threatened
to bring hot tears. “We’re obliged to win! We
just must! I’ll wear Georgia jeans—I’ll starve for
the cause. I would die for it, mother, if it would
help us to win!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not sheer bravado that had brought forth
this explosion. April was quite sincere in what she
said. The cause of the South was right and holy
in her eyes and she was ready to meet, with cheerfulness,
any sacrifice that might be demanded of her.
To doubt for a moment a successful issue of the struggle
seemed to her like a confession of disloyalty.</p>

<p class='c012'>This her mother well understood, but she also had
a fuller realization of the issues at stake and the resources
of the contending forces.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My darling April,” she said gently, “I don’t
want to spoil your party but it is better that you
should learn from me what this proclamation means
to the South. You will surely hear more of it tonight,
but now it will not come to you as a bitter surprise.
Let us drop the matter for the present and
I’ll help you into this,” she continued, picking up
from the bed a skirt of ruffled pink tarleton.
“Harry, light more candles. We’ll be extravagant
for once and take a good look at sister in all her
finery. It may be the last to run the blockade.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot sprang to her feet to light an improvised
candle which consisted of a corncob wrapped with a
twisted wick dipped in resin and wax. As there
were no matches to be had she was forced to kindle
it from the small fire burning on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, as she stooped, April shook her head decidedly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Harry, don’t,” she cried, crossing the room
hurriedly. “Just set the logs blazing and you shall
see me by fire-light and so save our candles. I’m
beginning to realize what is the matter with us-all of
the South. We’re ready enough with fine words or
big brave deeds, but we neglect the little things and
so waste our resources. From now on, I mean to
make the small sacrifices that are needed. If we all
do that, we shall be able to endure to the end and
win!”</p>

<p class='c012'>April was barely seventeen, but she spoke with a
fresh spirit of resolution and sincerity, and there was
a thoughtfulness in her beautiful face that gave it a
look of dawning maturity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I’ll do my share, too!” Harriot exclaimed,
carried away by her sister’s enthusiasm. “I can do
it, if April can. Hereafter I’ll not eat so much
poundcake—and I’ll see that Corinne doesn’t,
either.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May smiled a little sadly, wishing, perhaps,
that this willingness to accept privations had been
born of faith in another and better cause.</p>

    <div>A STRANGE GUEST</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The year 1863, which was ushered in by the
Emancipation Proclamation, was one of
steadily waning fortune for the Confederate
Cause. Even temporary successes in Virginia or
elsewhere could hardly blind the South to such blows
as the loss of Vicksburg and the Union victory of
Gettysburg. Hope flared up after Chickamauga,
but 1864 opened with no better prospect than had
1863, and resources dwindled steadily. Food became
so scarce that many were actually near the
starvation point. In the State of Georgia, however,
which, as yet, the war had touched but lightly, there
was comparative plenty, and the people of little
Washington, though they were forced to give up
many seeming necessities, lived in tolerable comfort.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus Mrs. May’s predictions apparently were far
from fulfillment, and April’s conviction of the ultimate
victory of the South was strengthened. Moreover,
Georgia crops were counted upon to feed the
army, and this kept men at home in legitimate employment
and the life of the community took on a
semblance of what it was in normal times. Officers
on recruiting service or attached to the military
prisons at Andersonville and Millen, were to be seen
everywhere; so that there was no lack of escorts for
ladies, who never stirred out of their native towns
without a gentleman in attendance.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a continual round of parties and balls
which, though they lacked the lavishness of former
occasions, were gay and lively in spite of conditions
that might well have depressed a less sanguine people.</p>

<p class='c012'>And, as was natural, there was no hint upon the
part of the soldiers that victory for the Southern
arms was in the slightest degree doubtful. The
gallant captains and lieutenants who, with the courtly
grace of their time, bowed low over the dainty hands
of their fair partners in the dance, never failed to
promise success with so sincere a conviction that those
who listened thereafter turned a deaf ear to all suggestions
of possible defeat.</p>

<p class='c012'>That the Yankees had won battles was not denied;
but it served only to increase the bitterness in the
hearts of most Confederates, and there was a good
deal of talk at this time of seizing property belonging
to those who were suspected of sympathizing
with the North, of whom there were more than a few
in the State. But this came to nothing. There were,
indeed, some among the far-seeing Southerners who
were not above placing a portion of their crops in the
hands of these Union men, thinking thus to save a
little from the inevitable wreck.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the whole, however, April’s firm faith in the
triumph of her cause appeared to be justified. As
month after month passed, the memory of her
mother’s warning grew less impressive. Moreover,
the proclamation freeing the slaves had had no effect
whatever upon the negroes owned by Colonel May,
for they were well and kindly treated. Throughout
the country generally there was more or less restlessness
to be noted among the colored population, but
those of them who ran away fled from indifferent
or cruel masters, and the better class of Southerners
showed little sympathy for such owners.</p>

<p class='c012'>Moreover Mrs. May was one of the Kentucky
Harriots who had always opposed secession. She
had even heard herself referred to, in whispers to be
sure, as “Henry May’s Yankee wife.” And in her
own family she had never concealed a certain understanding
of the North and had deplored the action
of those hot-heads and politicians who had precipitated
the conflict. But her husband was the colonel
of a Georgia regiment, and her son, a lieutenant, and
it never occurred to her to oppose their decision once
it was taken.</p>

<p class='c012'>Between April and her mother there was a very
deep and true bond of affection; but, when Mrs. May
strove to soften her daughter’s bitterness toward the
Union, the girl could not forget the fact that Kentucky
was largely loyal to the North, and discounted
her mother’s opinion as being tinged with Yankee
sentiments which a true Georgian could not accept.
Thus, while there was no breach in their love for
each other, the elder woman realized that circumstances
made it impossible for her to ease the blow
she believed must some day shatter April’s hopes.
And the girl, seeing nothing of the increasing misery
outside her own prosperous circle, and hearing only
the most optimistic predictions from the scores of
young officers who danced attendance upon her
whenever the opportunity afforded, grew increasingly
confident and was more than ever ready to
testify to her loyalty by a resentment toward anything
that savored of sympathy for her enemies.
Yet out of this well-nigh fanatical spirit unhappiness
was bound to come. Already April hid a secret sorrow
which sometimes brought tears to wet her pillow
ere she went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>The passing of a year changed Harriot but little.
She was still a most practical and unsentimental
young person who looked upon the procuring of food
for herself as the first duty of a growing girl. It
was with no surprise, therefore, that Mortality, another
of Aunt Decent’s granddaughters, found her,
one warm day in the early part of 1864, discreetly
screened behind some shrubbery, munching persimmon
dates.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, here yoh is!” exclaimed Mortality, flopping
down on the grass beside the rustic chair on which
Harriot sat. “Ah was a-thinkin’ yoh might know
who-all ’tis what’s comin’ in. More refugee-ers, I
’spects.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, goodness!” cried Harriot, standing up
suddenly and peering through the bushes at a rather
dilapidated ambulance drawn by two very thin mules
which was slowly nearing the house. “If any more
people come here I’ll have to sleep in a trundle bed
in April’s room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot’s wail was not without justice. Already
the May house was overflowing with less fortunate
individuals who had been driven out of their own
homes or who were breaking their journeys about the
country. The rich planters of the South boasted of
their hospitality, and now that war had brought privations
to less fortunate friends they felt an added
obligation to share all they possessed. Every household
that could afford it, sheltered some “refugees,”
as those were called who had been forced to forsake
their own homes.</p>

<p class='c012'>But this new arrival at the May establishment
hardly appeared to be one of these. As Harriot
watched, she saw a young girl maneuver her wide
hoops through the narrow door of the ancient vehicle
and proceed gravely about the business of superintending
the disposal of her luggage upon the broad
piazza. Then, having paid the driver, the newcomer
sat down upon one of her brass-studded boxes with
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Clare to goodness,” chuckled Mortality, “that
fancy miss ac’s lack she’d done come to stay. An
she don’t appear to have no folks neither.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She must have come to the wrong house,”
Harriot whispered. She had watched the proceedings
of the stranger with increasing interest. There
were no congenial girls of her own age living near,
and her cousin Corinne was too grown-up to have
any fun with these days. Harriot would have been
glad to find a playmate; but she shook her head, being
certain that this calm young stranger had made a
mistake. No such guest was expected, that she
knew.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mother and April are away, so I reckon I’d
better tell her,” she went on half to herself, and,
stepping out briskly from behind the shrubbery, she
hurried toward the house, followed by Mortality.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is Mr. Henry May’s house,” Harriot began
at once. “Colonel Henry May, you know. He’s
my father, but of course he’s with the army.” She
paused a moment, but no answer being forthcoming
she continued rather breathlessly: “Mrs. Gordon
May’s place is over on the Abbeville road. Perhaps
they are the ones you’re looking for—or maybe the
Beaumont Mays, though they’re no kin to us and
are living in Augusta now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Again she paused, but the only response was a
widening of the girl’s smile, and Harriot grew
slightly embarrassed; but she noted the well-made
and rather fashionable clothes of this silent stranger
and her regret continued to deepen.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a pity that man drove off so fast,” she went
on, feeling that some one must talk. “Our horses
have mostly been pressed, and I don’t know what
I’ll find to send you away in, ’specially as mother and
April are at the Ladies’ Aid meeting, sewing for the
soldiers. But of course I’m ’bliged to find something.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Deed, Miss Harry, ’tain’t no use talkin’,” Mortality
half whispered. “Don’t you-all see she’s one
of ’em dumbies?”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this the strange girl laughed outright, a bright,
cheerful laugh that set Harriot to smiling too.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Really I’m not dumb,” the visitor said with a
chuckle. “I’ve just been wondering what happened
to all my letters. I wrote weeks ago that I was
coming.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you did?” Harriot replied vaguely.
“Well, of course, now-a-days letters never go where
you expect them to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The other nodded calmly, and Harriot regarded
her with increasing admiration. She was so cool and
self-possessed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At any rate, I’m here now!” the girl on the
trunk remarked philosophically. “It’s too late to
help that, isn’t it? But, if I’m in the way, I can go
back to New York, can’t I? Though it’ll probably
be no end of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To New York!” Harriot exclaimed incredulously.
“Did you run the blockade?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” the other answered rather regretfully.
“I wanted to—it would be a fine adventure,
wouldn’t it?—but I wasn’t allowed. Papa wished
me to travel by land, so they sent me down under a
flag of truce. This is your mother coming in, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>A carriage was rolling briskly into the drive and
in another moment it drew up at the block near the
porch. As Mrs. May descended the stranger slipped
down from the trunk and went to meet her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sorry, Aunt Parthenia,” she said precisely.
“I fancy I should have waited for an invitation from
you, shouldn’t I? But father had to leave so unexpectedly—and
even though we had had no answer
to our letters he said it would be best for me to come,
as he had information that you were still here. If
you don’t want me, I suppose I can arrange for another
flag of truce to go back under, can’t I?”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was just the shadow of a break in the gentle
voice as the strange girl said this; and the crisp pronunciation
with its broad “a,” so different from the
slow Southern drawl, held a certain appeal that went
straight to Mrs. May’s heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear child, of course you must stay,” she
said, taking the young girl in her motherly arms.
“You are most welcome but—but, honey, who are
you?”</p>

    <div>A GLIMPSE OF MR. LINCOLN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At Mrs. May’s question the strange girl drew
back from the motherly embrace and glanced
up at the older woman almost reproachfully.
“I should think you would know who I am when
I called you ‘Aunt Parthenia,’” she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear,” Mrs. May hastened to reply, “half
of Alabama and nearly all of Georgia call me ‘Aunt
Parthenia.’ Between the Mays and the Harriots
I have so many connections that I can’t remember
them all. Especially those I’ve never seen.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The girl’s face brightened immediately.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am Dorothea Drummond,” she announced,
and with the words the mystery was ended. Once
more she was folded in Mrs. May’s arms with a
warmth that left no doubt of the affection that
prompted it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Susie’s baby!” Mrs. May exclaimed. “My little
sister’s baby! Girls! Girls!” she cried excitedly
to her two daughters, “this is your own cousin
from England.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m mighty glad you did come to the right place
after all!” Harriot burst out, taking her cousin’s
hand and shaking it vigorously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Even though you thought I was a ‘dumby’?”
Dorothea laughed back, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never did think so,” Harriot protested, and
then turned to Mortality, who was gaping curiously.
“Itty, you run to Aunt Decent right off and tell her
my cousin, Miss Dorothea, is here, and is as hungry
as she can be. We’ll be out presently. Run now.
You are hungry, of course,” she went on, addressing
Dorothea, as Mortality scampered away.
“You’re ’bliged to be, after coming all the way from
England.”</p>

<p class='c012'>By this time April had dismissed the carriage and
joined them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are very glad to see you, Dorothea,” she
said, leaning down and kissing the girl warmly. Her
welcome was sincere, for not only was she attracted
by Dorothea’s appearance, but the fact that this new
cousin had come from England, where the South still
counted upon sympathy for their cause, was an additional
reason for cordiality. “I thought you were
about my age,” she added with an inviting smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am past fifteen,” Dorothea replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you’re my cousin most!” Harriot insisted.
“I’m not fourteen yet, but you’re nearer my age
than you are April’s.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re just a baby, Harry,” April teased.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, it’s horrid to be the youngest!” her sister
protested. “Your family never want you to grow
up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think it’s rather worse to be both the youngest
and the oldest,” Dorothea put in, laughing. “Then
you’re expected to be both grown-up and a baby,
too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the same you’re mostly my age,” Harriot
maintained stoutly, and, as if to seal their friendship,
she, too, kissed Dorothea enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But that doesn’t make her any more your cousin
than she is mine,” April contended. “You needn’t
think, Harry, that you are going to have Dorothea
all to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was said so sweetly that the newcomer, looking
up into the face of the radiant girl before her, felt
a warm throb in her heart. She was no longer a
stranger. Her experiences in New York and Washington
had not served to break through the reserve
that she came, one day, to recognize as the British
side of her character; but her welcome here had
none of the English formality to which she was accustomed.
This Southern greeting, with its frank
cordiality, stirred within her a response hitherto unknown.
She was a little puzzled at the dawning of
a new day in her outlook upon life.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You girls will have to share a cousin, but she
is all my niece,” Mrs. May laughed. “Come in,
my dear,” she went on, putting an arm about Dorothea.
“You will find that we are without many
things to make you as comfortable as we should like;
but we are not the least, tiny bit less glad to see you
on that account.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She led the way into the breakfast room where
a substantial “refreshment” was being prepared for
this latest guest. And here, after she had eaten a
little, Dorothea told of her experiences in Washington
before she started South.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I really did come from England to visit you,
Aunt Parthenia,” she said. “You know you wrote
many times that you would be glad to see me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course!” Mrs. May nodded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” the girl went on, “father had to come
over on diplomatic business, and I begged him to
bring me because I wanted to know my relations in
America. When we sailed every one thought that
the war would be ended by the time we arrived; but
it wasn’t, so I stayed with father in Washington. I
wrote you as soon as we landed, saying I was coming;
and father had the letter sent through the lines.
But, of course, I was not very much surprised at not
hearing from you; though it never occurred to me
that you might not have received my letter. Then,
quite suddenly, just when we were nicely settled,
father was ordered to South America.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And was he ’bliged to go?” demanded Harriot,
munching the remains of a pecan praline garnered
from Dorothea’s lunch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, of course,” her cousin answered. “That is
the way it always is in the Diplomatic Service. You
can’t ever tell where you may be sent the next day.
There was a ship leaving almost immediately, and
father only had an hour or two to get ready if he
was to reach New York in time to sail. He was
for starting me back to England with Fräulein—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who was she?” asked April.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My governess and companion,” Dorothea replied
with a laugh. “I wonder where she is now,
poor Fräulein? Well, I teased father to let me try
to come here if I could safely, and he said I might.
Then he took the train, and a few days afterward
I started South.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, my dear,” Mrs. May exclaimed, “there
must have been something more than that. How
could you travel without an escort?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Besides, the Yankees would never let you
through their lines,” April put in bitterly. “Did
you run the blockade?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought for a little while I should have to, if
I was to come at all,” Dorothea continued. “You
see, just before he left, father wrote a letter to the
Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton, asking that I be permitted
to go through the Union lines on my way
here. So the next day I went to see Mr. Stanton.
It was a long time before I was let into his office;
but at last I was, and he sat at a large desk with
father’s letter, which I had sent in to him, in his
hand. He looked at me pretty sharply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Well, young lady,’ he began at once. ‘You
might have spared yourself this trip. I have issued
the last pass through our lines.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“He said it as if he were rather pleased to have
a chance to growl at me. You see the English are
not popular in Washington—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is to their everlasting credit,” April broke
in warmly. “They are all friends of the Confederacy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is what Mr. Stanton was thinking,” Dorothea
went on, nodding her head wisely. “Father
had warned me that there might be trouble. The
Secretary, of course, didn’t want to offend the English
if he could help it, and I didn’t mean to be put
off so easily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Surely you could let me have a pass, sir, couldn’t
you?’ I pleaded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘I could—but I won’t,’ he answered gruffly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘My father thought you might take his position
somewhat into consideration,’ I suggested
meekly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Then he should have written to Seward!’ the
Secretary of War snapped out angrily. ‘I am not
one of those who think it would do any good to our
cause to favor the English.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But the Drummonds are Scots, sir,’ I reminded
him, at which he threw up his head like a restive
horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘It is the same thing,’ he cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Ye’ll nae find a Scotsman agreein’ wi’ ye in
that, Mr. Secretary,’ I retorted, for you know we
are not English and it annoys us to have people
think we are.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Before he could reply we were both surprised
to hear a low chuckle of amusement and I turned to
meet the gaze of a tall, lanky man, whom, of course,
I recognized at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Abe Lincoln!” ejaculated Harriot scornfully,
and Dorothea eyed her younger cousin with a momentary
look of surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’d never think of calling him that if once
you’d seen him,” she went on slowly. “I don’t
know quite how to describe him—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They say he’s the ugliest man in America,” April
interrupted with a laugh of derision.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but he isn’t ugly!” Dorothea protested
earnestly. “Truly he isn’t. He’s not like any
other man I ever saw. I looked up into his face,
and it was so sad that my heart just ached and I felt
that I wanted to comfort him, only—only there
wasn’t any way I could do it, was there? And he
was tired, too, dreadfully tired. You could tell
from the droop of his body—and his eyes. But all
that I noticed later. When I turned round first, he
was smiling and watching me with so pleasant a look
that I wasn’t at all afraid or embarrassed, as one
would have expected.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Well, little girl,’ he said, just as father might
have said it, ‘I think you scored on the Secretary of
War that time; though indeed we all make the same
mistake in this country. But what is it all about?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“He put his hand on my shoulder and we stood
together before Mr. Stanton, who scowled up at us
for all the world like an angry schoolmaster at two
naughty pupils.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘The young lady is the daughter of Mr. Drummond
of the British Embassy,’ the Secretary
grudgingly explained. ‘She wishes to go to
Georgia, and I have just told her that it is impossible.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Hum!’ murmured Mr. Lincoln, looking down
at me with a twinkle in his eye though his face was
quite sober. ‘So you think she is too dangerous a
person to receive a pass through our lines, Mr. Secretary?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘I intend to issue no more passes, Mr. President,’
Mr. Stanton said bluntly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Again Mr. Lincoln looked down at me, drawing
a long face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘You know he’s quite right,’ he murmured, half
to himself. ‘The pass privilege has been greatly
abused, no doubt of that, and when the Secretary of
War puts his foot down there’s no moving him. I
suppose we’ll have to go over to the Secretary of
State and see what he can do for us.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Stanton snorted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Mr. President!’ he exploded, ‘is our cause to
be jeopardized by the weakness of a man who can’t
say “No”?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Is our cause so weak that it will be put in
jeopardy by letting a little girl pass through our
lines?’ Mr. Lincoln answered patiently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know what Mr. Stanton might have said
to that, for before he could speak a man in uniform
came hurrying in with a dispatch in his hand which
he laid on the desk. The messenger himself seemed
excited and much pleased, as if he bore good news.
The Secretary glanced at it and then jumped to his
feet with an exclamation of delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘This is better than we could possibly have expected,
Mr. President!’ he cried, handing the paper
to Mr. Lincoln. I do not know what it was all
about, but it was plainly something which was favorable
to the North, and I watched Mr. Lincoln as
he took the message, only to see an expression of
deep sadness come over his face. Whatever he read
on the yellow slip in his hand brought no gladness
to his heart. He stood there, forgetting all about us,
and gazed out of the window with the look of one
who had learned of a great sorrow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Stanton watched him for a moment and
seemed to grow irritated at his lack of enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Are you displeased with the news, Mr. President?’
he asked irritably.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘My grief is for all those who suffer,’ was the
quiet answer and Mr. Lincoln handed back the message
to the Secretary who sat down at his desk again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then the President turned to me once more and,
noting that Mr. Stanton was busying himself with
other matters, he led me into an alcove beside a
wide window and asked me all about myself; who I
was, why I wanted to go South and if I was interested
in the war? And I told him the truth, which
was that I hadn’t thought very much about it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then I suppose he asked you if you’d read
‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ and gave you a copy,” April
cut in sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea gave a funny little chuckle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not exactly, but he did wish to know if I’d read
it and what I thought of it. And I said I thought
it very long, at which he seemed highly amused
and agreed with me heartily. After that, for some
time, he looked out of the window evidently thinking
deeply, all the while jingling some keys or coins
in his pocket, but at length he spoke again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘My dear,’ he said, gently, ‘you tell me you are
going South on a visit to a little country village.
Perhaps, down there, you may escape this war.
Maybe before you return it will be all over; but remember
that the South is a part of my country as
dear to me as is the North. I have ready a
Proclamation of Amnesty for the whole South, from
Mr. Davis down to the humblest citizen, which shall
be published the moment they lay down their arms.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The South will not have to beg Mr. Lincoln for
mercy!” cried April. “But he seems to have made
a Yankee of you, Cousin Dorothea,” she added, a
little suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no,” Dorothea answered quickly. “I’ve always
been for the South, you know. ’Most everybody
in England is, but I do admire Mr. Lincoln.
I can’t help that. He’s queer, and his clothes don’t
fit him, and—and—Oh, I can’t explain what
I feel—but, when you talk to him, you know in
your heart that he is a great man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She spoke so earnestly and seriously that for a
moment her hearers were impressed and there was
silence around the table.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I want to hear about your coming through the
lines,” Harriot broke out at last. “It must have
been great fun.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think that had better wait till Dorothea is
settled down,” Mrs. May said, rising to her feet.
“Come with me, my dear, and I’ll show you to
your room.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a charming room, Aunt Parthenia!” Dorothea
exclaimed, glancing out of the window
overlooking the box-edged beds of the flower
garden, but noting particularly the cheerful blaze
on the hearth. “I shall love it here so much that
I shan’t ever want to go away again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May turned from straightening the curtains
at the front where the windows opened on the gallery
roof.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s very prettily said, my dear,” she returned.
“We shouldn’t like anything better than
to have you stay always in your American home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a suspicion of tears in Dorothea’s eyes
as she looked up at her aunt and then, impulsively,
she put her arms about the elder woman with a
convulsive hug.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I really have never had a home,” she murmured,
half to herself; and Mrs. May, understanding what
was in the girl’s heart, patted her shoulder lovingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“April is next door to you and I’m just across the
hall,” Harriot explained a moment later.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where she can look down upon the cook-house,
and see just what’s going on,” April said, banteringly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed I can,” Harriot admitted unblushingly.
“I always know what Aunt Decent is baking by the
smells coming in at the windows. You’ll find that
my room has decided advantages, Dorothea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>While they were waiting for the trunks to be
brought up Dorothea, yielding to Harriot’s insistent
demands for the story of her adventures on the way
from Washington, told briefly what had happened.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It wasn’t very much,” she began. “Everything
was made very easy for me, and all the people I met
were so pleasant and kind, that it seemed as if I was
finding friends wherever I went. All the Americans
are like that, aren’t they? It’s different in England.
Of course, as I might have expected though I didn’t,
Fräulein lost all her courage and refused to go.
You might have thought she would have to fight.
She talked of both armies as if they wouldn’t have
anything to do but kill us. But I wasn’t to be put off.
There was a Mrs. Warren and her two children who
were going through the lines at the same time, and
she looked after me till we reached Charlotte.
There I was handed over to a Miss Pettigrew who
brought me here. So you see,” Dorothea ended, “it
wasn’t much of an adventure after all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but you haven’t told us about the soldiers,
or the flag of truce or—or lots of things you must
have seen,” Harriot suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There isn’t really much to tell,” Dorothea returned;
but in her answer there was a hint of reluctance
to talk of the matter. “We crossed a river
called the Rappahannock in boats with a white flag
flying, ‘under the special protection of the two great
American armies,’ they said. There was a rope
stretched on the Southern side and a Confederate
officer met us, lifting the barrier to let us through.
All the officers on each side were very polite and
friendly to each other, exchanging newspapers and
inquiring for mutual friends; but before we knew
it everything was all over. After that, we were
driven over awful roads to call on one of your commanding
officers to deliver our passes and thanks for
our special truce, as is customary. Oh, here are my
boxes and I want to unpack them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Seeming glad of a diversion which allowed a
change of subject, Dorothea ended her recital
abruptly and turned to where two colored boys were
unstrapping her luggage. Mrs. May watched her
for a moment and unconsciously shook her head as
if a little puzzled. April, her eyes upon the floor,
sat immovable, as if her thoughts were very far away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder why she doesn’t want to talk about the
soldiers?” Harriot asked herself. All three had
noted something of a lack of frankness that had
set them wondering.</p>

<p class='c012'>But trunks fresh from outside the blockade had
a strong attraction for April and Harriot. Mrs.
May, too, did not attempt to conceal her curiosity.
However she had many household duties that called
for immediate attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m just as anxious to see your pretty things as
the girls,” she said, as she rose to leave the room;
“but I am obliged to wait till later. I’ll send Merry
up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At once there was a protest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We don’t need her!” Harriot exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let us help Dorothea, mother,” April proposed,
a little excited in anticipation of a look at foreign
finery.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well,” Mrs. May agreed and went away
regretfully. She, too, was anxious to see if the
fashions had changed greatly during the years when
the war had cut them off almost wholly from the
rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>Left to themselves the three girls contemplated
the fine array of boxes and trunks, which seemed
to hold an excessive amount of apparel for one young
lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gracious me!” exclaimed Harriot. “It’s good
those two big wardrobes are in this room. You
must have a dress for every day in the month.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait and you’ll see what I have,” Dorothea
laughed knowingly. “There are lots of things besides
clothes. I had to be very careful about my
packing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why?” demanded the practical Harriot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because the Union army wanted to be sure I
wasn’t carrying anything down here that would
be useful,” Dorothea explained. “They examine
everything, of course. I suspected it would be like
the customs house business in Europe, so I prepared.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And did they dare to search through everything?”
demanded April indignantly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, not <i>everything</i>,” Dorothea answered with
a significant emphasis on the last word. “The man
who was detailed to look over my luggage was
awfully nice. He asked me at once if I had anything
in my boxes that would give ‘aid or comfort to the
enemy’ and I said, ‘No, sir! because I don’t call an
aunt or a cousin an enemy, do you?’ He laughed
and remarked he’d heard of those ‘as was enemies
and those as wasn’t’; but when I told him I came
from England, he looked at all my traps, shook his
head and let them go through without much bother.
As a matter of fact he fastened bands of white
muslin on them with dabs of red sealing-wax to show
they were ‘passed packages’—and you know I
was just a little disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why?” demanded Harriot. “If he let
them through without mussing everything, I should
think you would have been glad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh! but I’d packed them so carefully,” Dorothea
answered with a knowing smile. “Come, let’s
have a look—but you’ll be careful, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>All three set to work but they had not gone far
when Dorothea had to repeat her warning.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look out for that. Cousin April,” she said, as
the older girl took a tightly rolled silk parasol out
of the trunk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s mighty pretty,” April remarked, looking
at it curiously, “but not very perishable. I don’t
see why I need be ’specially careful of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Open it over the bed,” Dorothea advised, and,
when her suggestion was followed, a shower of pills
fell out.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” cried April and Harriot in one breath.
“You hid contraband in it. What are these, Dorothea?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Opium pills!” was the answer. “I read in the
papers that the poor Southern soldiers had little to
stop the pain of their wounds, so I brought as much
as I could. It isn’t very easy to get in Washington,
though I sent to a lot of chemists’ shops so I
wouldn’t be suspected.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s fine!” exclaimed April. “We’ve had
an awful time about opium. Last year it rained
just at the wrong time and our rows of poppies had
very few flowers on them. We have been very short
of it since.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And it’s a dreadfully sticky task to get the
opium,” Harriot explained, twisting up her face.
“We have to pick the poppy heads when they’re ripe
and pierce them with a coarse needle. Then we
have to catch the gum in a cup and let it dry. We’re
hoping to get a lot this summer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, as they talked, the unpacking went
on, and presently April held up a beautiful French
doll of huge proportions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is this for little Harriot?” she asked, with a
teasing grin at her younger sister who had never,
even in her younger days, had any taste for dolls.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s one of the things I was most disappointed
about,” Dorothea answered. “I just longed for the
examining officer to find that, and I had made up my
mind to tell him it was for my little Cousin Harriot;
but he never noticed it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s very pretty,” Harriot remarked coldly, “but
I’m a trifle too old for dolls.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not for this one,” Dorothea cried. “It’s
stuffed with ground coffee and quinine pills.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I’d be glad to have it,” Harriot shouted,
ready to laugh at herself. “Give it to me, April.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no!” her sister replied, retreating across the
room. “Dorothea didn’t say she brought it for you.
She said she was <i>going</i> to <i>say</i> that. However, you
can have the pills, if you want them. They’re fine
and bitter, worse than any dog-wood berry ones you
ever tasted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll have some of the coffee, too,” Harriot insisted.
“Oh, just imagine a cup of real coffee! I
believe I’ve forgotten what it tastes like. But,
Dorothea, how did you ever think of such a thing as
stuffing a doll with coffee?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It wasn’t my own idea at all,” Dorothea confessed.
“Some years ago, when father and I were
traveling on the Continent, we saw a woman who
tried the same trick in one of the custom houses.
I can still remember my horror when the officer who
was examining her luggage picked up a perfectly
beautiful doll, all dressed in flowered silk, and deliberately
snapped off its head, in spite of the fact
that she told him it was for her brother’s little girl
who was ill. But I was more astonished when the
man drew out yards and yards of the finest lace which
was concealed in the doll’s body. That’s what gave
me the idea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such are the advantages of travel,” said April
quizzically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must be great fun to go everywhere,” Harriot
put in half enviously. “Nobody I know ever went
any farther than New Orleans or the White Sulphur.
I’ve only been to the plantation and back, and that
wasn’t even out of Georgia. I certainly should like
to travel in Europe, wouldn’t you, April?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed I should,” her sister agreed. “You are
quite to be envied, Dorothea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m not so sure of that,” was the unexpected answer.
“It isn’t so much fun as you’d think. Most
of the time you live in hotels and keep wondering
if they are clean. Father and I would love a chance
to settle down and have a home of our own. We
talk a lot about it; but, somehow, there never comes
a time when we can do it. Look out, April, that
hat’s full of tea!” she exclaimed suddenly. “You’ll
find it between the crown and the lining.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May came in again at that moment to see
how the unpacking was progressing and stayed to
praise the thoughtfulness and ingenuity that had
brought them so many long-foregone luxuries.</p>

<p class='c012'>“China tea!” she exclaimed, snuffing it longingly.
“Yes, it’s there, I can smell it. How good
it will taste after the sassafras and raspberry leaves
we’ve been drinking. But,” she went on with a drop
in her voice, “I think we must keep it for invalids.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Aunt Parthenia, I brought it for you!”
Dorothea insisted. “They are presents from papa—the
medicines and groceries—and he’d want <i>you</i>
to have them, wouldn’t he? In that box there are
some things I picked out myself for you and the
girls.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea, flushed with pleasure at the reception
her gifts were receiving, opened another trunk in
some little excitement. On her knees before it she
paused in momentary embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know whether you’ll laugh at what I’ve
brought; but I read in the papers how short you
were of such things in the South and I thought they
might be more useful than just luxuries.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So saying she produced package after package of
trimmings, ribbons, buttons, sewing silk, pins,
needles, hair-pins and other feminine oddments. At
each fresh discovery of these simple treasures Mrs.
May and the two girls gave expression to their surprise
and delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Real pins!” exclaimed Mrs. May, looking at
them as if they were strange and little known treasures.
“I hoarded my last dozen for months, but
they vanished long ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And real needles, mother, see!” cried Harriot.</p>

<p class='c012'>April laughed gayly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’d think that Harry cared for nothing in the
world so much as sewing,” she teased.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do sew sometimes,” Harriot protested.
“And now that we have some truly buttons, not persimmon
seeds, I’ll do more of it. I like to sew on
buttons when we have them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think the pins are the greatest blessing you
could have brought us, Dorothea,” Mrs. May assured
her enthusiastically. “I am so tired of sticking
things together with thorns and pretending they
are pins because they have sealing-wax heads.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then they began to find the dainty dresses, and
lengths of fine materials that Dorothea had brought
and, like four women anywhere, they were completely
absorbed in fingering them and admiring
them, each, no doubt, wondering if they would be
becoming. They laughed and joked, praising this
or that piece of silk, or camel’s hair, or de beige, and
forgetting everything else for the time being. Then
suddenly Dorothea stopped talking and listened.
She had heard a gentle knocking at the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some one wishes to come in, Aunt Parthenia,”
she said, calling attention to the summons.</p>

<p class='c012'>But as she spoke the door slowly opened and there
appeared on the threshold, the dearest, sweetest
white-haired little lady that Dorothea had ever seen,
who at the sight of the finery scattered about, clasped
her hands in delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fal-lals!” she exclaimed. “Oh joy!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Imogene,” cried Mrs. May, “here are
things that will delight your heart. I didn’t know
you were in. But this is Susie’s daughter from England
who has just arrived. I’m sure you’ll love
her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea’s heart went out, on the instant, to this
lady who, with a smile of welcome, came swiftly into
the room and held out her arms.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your mother was my dearest friend, my child,”
she said in a low, musical voice that seemed to
thrill the girl. “I am overjoyed to see her
daughter.”</p>

    <div>CONFIDENCES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Miss Imogene’s white hair gave
Dorothea the impression that she was quite
an old lady; but that quickly vanished. There
were no betraying wrinkles in the bright face and the
girl was puzzled, for, in spite of a certain youthfulness,
there was also the suggestion of a past generation
in the ways of this new-found friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene was very small, with the tiniest
hands and feet, and she walked as if borne from
place to place upon the air. When she spoke it was
in a gentle, plaintive voice which seemed to belie
the sprightly expressions she used and the sparkling
wit and raillery that were ever ready on her tongue.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was dressed daintily and with care. The
material of her gown was far from fine, and the ribbons
and ornaments of the luxurious days before the
war were absent. Nevertheless she had the manner
of wearing costly stuffs and carried herself with a
certain style that was the envy of many a younger
woman.</p>

<p class='c012'>She embraced Dorothea tenderly, with a little
catch of her breath as if this meeting brought back
vivid remembrances of past joys and sorrows.
Then holding the girl at arms’ length she surveyed
her critically with sparkling black eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bless me, Parthenia!” she exclaimed, “she is as
dark as I am, and yet I can see my dear Susie’s face
again. We shall love each other,” she went on directly
to Dorothea. “I intend to make you love me
for your mother’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think I love you already,” Dorothea answered
half-shyly. Indeed this quaint little lady had the
knack of winning those with whom she came into
contact.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everybody loves Cousin Imogene,” Harriot declared.
“You just can’t help it, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The boys as well as the girls,” April laughed;
“so look out for your beaux, Dorothea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do not believe all that they say, my dear,” Miss
Imogene protested with the very faintest of becoming
blushes. “They love to tease their old cousin.
And now let me see the finery you have brought from
the outside world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was soon hovering over the silks and satins
and fine linen Dorothea spread out for them to admire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah,” murmured Miss Imogene, holding a gay
flowered muslin in her dainty fingers, “I wore a dress
made of a material quite like that when Larry
Stanchfield gave his celebrated supper. You remember,
’Thenia.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed I do,” Mrs. May answered with a knowing
glance at the other. “And I remember his toast
‘To the fairest of all dark women! Fairer than
any blonde.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you really recollect that?” murmured Miss
Imogene.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, my dear, and I know whose slipper he
drank it out of,” Mrs. May continued. “It was a
very gay party and not one to be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the dresses were cut very differently in those
days,” Miss Imogene said, a little hurriedly, almost
as if she wished to change the subject.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But whose slipper was it?” demanded the inquisitive
Harriot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cousin Imogene’s, of course,” April responded,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that true?” Harriot insisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, honey,” Miss Imogene replied. “I
dropped it as I was getting into our coach when we
went home after the Militia Ball. Dear me, how
long ago that seems!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And didn’t you ever get it back?” Harriot questioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, not that one, but the next day a little glass
slipper came, filled with sweet hearts,” Miss Imogene
answered with the most charming of smiles.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ve seen it on your dressing-table!” the two
girls cried delightedly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that is the very one,” Miss Imogene confessed.
“And there was a bit of verse with it.
Let’s see if I remember it.” She looked up at the
ceiling a moment, her eyes half closed as if she could
see there the picture she brought back in her mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, now I know. It went like this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Accept, fair lady, in exchange</div>
      <div class='line in6'>For one I hold,</div>
      <div class='line'>This crystal slipper filled with hearts</div>
      <div class='line in6'>From one made bold</div>
      <div class='line'>By Cupid, who alas, can find no shoe to fit</div>
      <div class='line'>Which will contain the hearts that seek a place in it.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“It is rather pretty, don’t you think?” she ended,
appealing to them all with the gentlest of smiles.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think it’s beautiful,” said Dorothea enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c012'>Already she was growing to love this strange lady
who, while she was quick to realize the present,
seemed also to be dwelling in the past.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But who sent it, Cousin Imogene?” demanded
the inquisitive Harriot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Harry,” said her mother rather sharply, “don’t
ask so many questions.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I wanted to know,” Harriot persisted, and
there was a momentary argument before the matter
was disposed of; although Dorothea noticed that
Miss Imogene did not betray the name of the gentleman
who had sent her the crystal slipper.</p>

<p class='c012'>It took a good while to unpack all of the trunks,
for each piece of finery was exhibited and talked over
and admired by these Southern ladies whom the war
had now deprived of all such pretty things. But it
was finally accomplished. The cupboards and bureau
drawers were filled and the empty boxes banished
to the attic.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At last, my dear, you are at home,” said Mrs.
May as she surveyed the room, once more in order.
“And you must rest an hour before supper.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I really don’t feel tired, Aunt Parthenia,” Dorothea
demurred; “I never take naps.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Neither do I!” Harriot put in with a note
of triumph; decidedly this new cousin was to her
taste.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I always do,” Miss Imogene remarked
placidly. “It keeps the roses blooming longer in
our cheeks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With a light laugh she went off with April, followed
by the reluctant Harriot, who seemed very
averse to leaving Dorothea even for a moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall wait and see that you obey me,” Mrs.
May said as she closed the door behind her daughter.
“Come, my dear, put on a wrapper and rest, even
if you don’t sleep.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea set about doing as Mrs. May suggested,
glad to have the elder lady to herself for a little.
It was more than just a visit to her relatives in
Georgia that had brought her there, though the chief
reason lay very deep in her heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aunt Parthenia,” she began as she sat in a comfortable
chair beside her aunt, “you are glad to see
me, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May guessed what was in her mind, indeed
she had stayed behind the others on purpose to have
a little talk with her niece. So she reached out and
took the girl’s hand gently in her own.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dearest child,” she said warmly, “I am
more than glad to see you. Your mother was my
only sister, and I can’t tell you how I have longed to
know the little girl she left behind. Do you remember
her at all, honey?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A little,” Dorothea answered. “Of course I
was very small when she died, but I can still recollect
a dear face that bent over me before I went to sleep
at night. Even now I see it sometimes, just as I am
going off. One of the things I want most was to
have you tell me about her. Father says hardly anything—it
hurts him to think about it, I know, because
I can always see a shadow come over his face
when I mention my mother. So I do not like to
make his heart ache. But, oh, Aunt Parthenia, I
have longed for some one to talk to who remembers
her. She was very pretty, wasn’t she? Does this
look like her?”</p>

<p class='c012'>On her wrist Dorothea wore a gold clasp mounted
on a red velvet ribbon, and opening this case she
showed it to her aunt.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May gazed at the picture, her eyes growing
soft in her recollection of the girlish face she saw,
and for a moment or two there was silence in the
room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is very like her, dear,” she said finally.
“Very like her, indeed. She was just as sweet and
pretty as this painting shows her to be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is how I think of her,” Dorothea remarked.
“And that is the face I see sometimes in my dreams.
But I am never sure whether it is my real mother or
the remembrance of the picture that I see. Yet,
somehow, I have felt sure she was like that and it is
a comfort to me to have the picture with me. It
makes her seem nearer to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you always wear it on your wrist?” asked
Mrs. May.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Always,” answered Dorothea. “Father told
me red was her favorite color, so I have a supply of
red ribbons to mount it on. And, you know, Aunt
Parthenia, except for father, who gave it to me, you
are the only one who has seen it. At school lots of
the girls wondered what was in the locket, but, somehow,
I never wanted to tell them. It was as if
mother and I had that little picture between us and
it wasn’t a thing you could show to strangers. You
think I’m right, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am sure you are, dear, if it gives you any comfort,”
Mrs. May answered earnestly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, it does,” Dorothea went on. “You see,
for a while I was at boarding-school and father was
all alone. Then he wanted me with him, for
mother’s sake mostly, I think, and ever since we have
been living first in one place and then in another, all
over the world. It’s been very interesting, but it
has never been like home; for of course I rarely
stayed anywhere long enough to make any real
friends. That is one of the reasons why I wanted
so much to see you and my cousins. That, and to
talk to you of mother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And to find a real home, Dorothea,” Mrs. May
murmured, patting the girl’s hand. “Hereafter, no
matter what happens, there is always a place for you
here, and the girls will soon be like your sisters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“April is wonderful,” Dorothea said warmly;
“and Harriot is so funny and dear. I know I shall
love them. Indeed I loved you all just as soon as I
saw you. You were all so good and kind and made
me feel welcome right away. In England, now, it
would have taken weeks and weeks before I should
have been able to talk to you like this.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I understand,” Mrs. May agreed, nodding.
“In the South you will find that every one is very
friendly. In one way or another most of the people
down here are kin to each other or else they are
friends of our friends, so it is just like one big family.
If it wasn’t for this terrible war you would see how
happily we live.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a pause for a moment, Dorothea looking
out of the window with her face very thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know, Aunt Parthenia,” she said, after a
little, “I saw the soldiers on both sides as I came
through.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I know,” Mrs. May replied, “and I thought
there was something you didn’t want to talk about.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There was,” Dorothea confessed; “I’m sure
you’ll understand, Aunt Parthenia, but I didn’t know
what the others might think. You see I don’t believe
the South can win the war—though I’m awfully
<i>for</i> it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What makes you say that, Dorothea?” Mrs.
May asked earnestly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because, when I came through the Northern
army,” Dorothea explained, “all the men I saw
looked well-fed and strong; everything they wanted
was at hand to make them comfortable; and they
were cheery and joked with each other; they were
like boys on a holiday. But when I came through
the Confederate lines it was awful, Aunt Parthenia.
The men looked half starved. They were in rags
and they looked so haggard and drawn, as if they
actually suffered. It isn’t fair that they should be
expected to fight against those strong men of the
North. It isn’t fair, Aunt Parthenia!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, my dear, it isn’t fair,” her aunt agreed.
“I wish this war had never come. There are those
who still doubt my loyalty to the Confederacy, for
I am not afraid to say we should never have seceded,
yet I <i>am</i> loyal to the South. It is my home, and the
home of all my friends and relatives. I love it, but
I have seen for a long time that there is only more
suffering and misery in store for us—and, in the
end, defeat. You will soon find to what shifts we
have already been put to manage to live. And here
in Georgia we are very well off. You are right that
it isn’t fair to ask our men to go on fighting against
overwhelming odds; but, my dear, don’t talk about
that here. The feeling against the North is very
bitter and any one who does not proclaim perfect
confidence that the South will win is treated like a
traitor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, I’ve always wanted you to win,”
Dorothea affirmed once more.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will hear only that side of the matter in
this house, honey,” Mrs. May cautioned. “We all
want the South to win, now war is here; but some of
us are very sorry that it was ever brought about. It
was the politicians did it, and you will do well to remember
that there are two sides to the story.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course I don’t know very much about it,”
Dorothea confessed. “Father, you know, doesn’t
talk about the war at all, even to me. But it’s so
different in the North. They have so much, and
somehow it’s natural to want the weaker side to win.
But, Aunt Parthenia, it is hard to believe that Mr.
Lincoln is the cruel man they say he is down here.
Once you’ve seen him and talked to him, you just
can’t believe that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am sure he is the best friend the South has, my
dear,” Mrs. May half whispered; “but that is quite
between ourselves. I shouldn’t dare say it to any
one else I know. Particularly to April. Remember,
honey, she is a very staunch Rebel.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I always think that mother would have been a
Rebel, too,” Dorothea said softly. “I fancy that’s
the reason I am one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You seem a very mild Rebel,” Mrs. May
laughed, getting to her feet; “and you’ll be a very
tired one if you don’t rest a little. Remember you
have a lot of people to meet to-night and I want my
Susie’s baby to do her mother justice.” She rose to
her feet and, leaning down, kissed the girl again.
“I am glad to have you here, dear, for your own
sake as well as for your mother’s.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea’s heart was too full to make a reply,
but she hugged her aunt, who understood, and a
moment later left the girl alone.</p>

    <div>RED STRINGS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>One of those most deeply interested in the arrival
of Dorothea was Lucy, the colored girl
whom Mrs. May had appointed to attend
upon her niece. Her mistress’s pretty clothes set
the little maid in an ecstasy of delight and she would
have liked nothing better than to dress Dorothea in
all of them, one after the other, to see how they
looked. She was ready for all sorts of gossip, and
while she combed and braided her young lady’s hair
she talked at a great rate of the quality folks in the
neighborhood, of “Ol’ Miss,” as she called Mrs.
May, and “Young Miss,” meaning April. A good
deal of the talk Dorothea could make neither head
nor tail of, but she liked to listen to the soft Southern
accents and smiled more than once at the unfamiliar
expressions, of which she comprehended but
half the meaning.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was almost dressed when there was a knock
at the door and Miss Imogene floated into the room
with her bright, bird-like air. She cocked her head
on one side as she surveyed Dorothea and then
nodded as if satisfied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You may run along now, Lucy,” she told the
maid; “I’ll finish Miss Dorothea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes’m,” Lucy replied, but she went reluctantly,
with many backward glances.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I couldn’t resist the temptation to look at you in
your finery before any one else, my dear,” Miss
Imogene began. “I wanted to see how far behind
the times our patterns are—and things look so different
in the hand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She, herself, was dressed with care, and, though
there were wanting touches here and there to show
the very latest whim of fashion, her hoops were as
wide as Dorothea’s and she looked as dainty as a
picture.</p>

<p class='c012'>She put the finishing touches to Dorothea’s toilet
and then sat down with a little gesture of invitation
to the girl to occupy a chair near her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ve a few minutes before all is ready downstairs,
and I thought you’d like to know something
of the people you are to meet,” Miss Imogene suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed I should,” Dorothea agreed, making herself
comfortable. “It’s awfully awkward if you
don’t know who is related to you and all about them.
And I have lived so far from my American relatives,
haven’t I?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene nodded understandingly, at the
same moment slipping a dainty finger inside a red
velvet band she wore about her neck as if it might be
a little tight. As she did this she glanced at Dorothea
rather keenly and a few moments later made a
gesture as if to brush back the hair from her forehead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“First of all there’s your Cousin Hal,” Miss
Imogene began. “The dearest boy I know. He’s
fighting, of course.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She named over half a dozen others of those who
were living for the time being at the Mays. Two or
three ladies “refugeeing,” or on their way to other
points and breaking the journey at Washington; a
number of officers in the Confederate Army, busy all
day with duties of one sort or another, consisting
mainly of gathering food or horses wherever they
could be found.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then there’s Val Tracy,” she went on.
“You’ll like him. He’s Irish and has a gay, blarneying
tongue. Compliments flow from him like water
down hill. He’s in the Army, though I think it is
more for the fun of fighting than for any faith he has
in the cause of the South.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene continued with her description of
the people Dorothea was soon to meet, and then
quite suddenly changed the subject.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorothea dear,” she asked abruptly, again
slipping her finger under the red band around her
neck, “have you heard any mention up North of the
Confederate prison at Andersonville?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was talked of a little, I think,” the girl answered
hesitatingly. “At least I don’t remember
whether that was the name, but there was something
in the papers about how badly the Union soldiers
were treated in the prisons here. I hope it isn’t
true.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am afraid there is more than a little truth in
what is being said,” Miss Imogene acknowledged.
“It isn’t all our fault, you know. We haven’t
enough to eat ourselves, so of course the prisoners
suffer like the rest of us. It is very hard on them,
poor souls. Many of them try to escape by coming
through Georgia. But there are few who get
away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A little later as they descended the broad stairs,
Dorothea heard so much talking and laughter that
she concluded there must be a special cause for rejoicing,
and was a little surprised to find that there
was no great news, no particular occasion for merriment,
other than the natural gayety of spirit that she
was to find universal among these Southerners among
whom she had come to live.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was introduced to the assembly one after the
other, and each had a pleasant and characteristic
word to say to her. Val Tracy, true to his reputation,
at once paid her a compliment, but in such a
bright laughing spirit that his extravagance of expression
was robbed of any offense.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have heard it is your way to say flattering
things,” Dorothea answered his little speech.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And to mean them, Miss Drummond,” he returned
with a bow. “Faith, the man would be dumb
who could fail to have a pretty speech on his tongue’s
tip when he sees so inspiring a subject.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t mind his blarney, Cousin Dorothea,” Hal
May laughed. “It’s notorious. After a while, you
won’t notice it any more. It’s only at first that it
makes an impression.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis better to make a first impression than none
at all,” Val laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re right, young man,” Miss Imogene said
gently; “and do not fear that even the oldest of us
resent your compliments. We like them, don’t we,
April?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed we do, Val,” April replied. “Hal is
too stupid to appreciate us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It takes an Irishman to do that, April,” Val protested.</p>

<p class='c012'>So the bantering went on through the supper and
Dorothea, sitting quietly looking from one to the
other about the table, thought it was strange indeed
that this company of young people should be so gay
and care-free with all the evidences of war about
them. Everything they saw must have reminded
them of the conflict. The young officers wore tattered
uniforms, stained and patched; the girls made-over
finery; the very food was so limited in variety
that Aunt Decent grumbled from morning till night.
And yet there was no faltering of the confidence these
charming Southerners had in the outcome. They
made light of their make-shifts; they laughed at the
privations they were forced to endure; they faced
with courage what might be in store for them, predicting
victory at the end.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea was in two minds whether to admire
them for their fortitude or to question whether they
had any realization of the seriousness of the times
in which they were living. It seemed as if they
gloried in scorning the thought that they might lose.
That contingency they put away from them, as they
did all other unpleasant facts. The English girl’s
first sight of these care-free people set her to wondering
if they could ever be serious. She could not
help but contrast this lightness with the different
view of the matter held in the North, where a universal
anxiety was met with on every hand. With
their gay laughter all about her she had a remembrance
of the sad face of Mr. Lincoln, who seemed
to grieve for all the suffering, no matter on whom it
fell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How can they win?” Dorothea asked herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I tell you it’s getting downright serious,” she
heard Val Tracy saying, as she brought her thoughts
back to her surroundings. “The Yankees seem to
know just what we mean to do and to prepare for it.
There have been a dozen plans that have had to be
abandoned. The South is full of spies!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And some of them are worse than that,” April
broke out passionately. “They are traitors!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that’s right,” her brother Hal put in.
“We’ve just learned that there’s a society all through
the South that is growing more powerful every
day. It’s called the Red Strings.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Red Strings?” cried a half dozen voices at
once.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where did you hear of them?” demanded Val
Tracy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No matter,” said Hal shortly; “but I’ll tell you
how they came to be organized. You all know that
ever since the war began there have been a lot of
cowards in this state, up in the North and East.
There are more in Tennessee and some in the Piedmont
region of North Carolina. Blackguards who
voted for the Union, all of them! Well, when war
was declared, you may be sure the first people our
conscript officers went for were these half-Yankees;
but they were mighty clever and took to the mountains.
When the officers went away, back they came
to their homes. They arranged it so that they were
warned in ample time of any attempt to draft them,
and pretty soon an organization grew up among
them. This developed until it occurred to some one
that here was a good crowd to help the Yankees and
the Abolitionists. To-day they’re scattered all over
the South, and it’s said there are a number of them
in our army itself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The traitors!” cried April. “They should all
be hung!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maybe,” said her brother, with a laugh, “but
first you have to catch them. They’re mighty slippery.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why are they called ‘Red Strings’?” asked
Miss Ivory, in her gentle voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because in the beginning,” Hal explained, “they
used to wear a piece of red, white and blue cord
somewhere about them so they would know each
other. But this was conspicuous and not easy to get,
so they adopted just a piece of red ribbon—anything
so it was red. A red string dyed with pine
roots would do. And they took their name from
that. They have passwords and signs, so they say;
but anyhow this society, which began among the poor
mountaineers, has come to be mighty powerful and
is making all sorts of trouble for us. They are helping
prisoners to escape from Andersonville and the
other camps. They are doing all they can for the
regular spies, and any information they get is sure to
be sent North to the Yankees sooner or later. It’s
a bad business.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then we’ll have to watch out for suspicious
people who wear red strings,” cried Val Tracy with
a chuckle. “Ah, ha! I see one already. Miss
Ivory has one about her neck.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a fine laugh at this.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You had better keep an eye on me after this,”
said that gentle lady with a serious face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, Miss Imogene,” cried Val contritely,
“’Twould give me joy—but I should as soon believe
Mr. Davis a traitor as you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea, suddenly conscious of some one staring
at her, raised her eyes to find April’s gaze fixed on
the red velvet ribbon around her wrist, but at the
same moment she noticed with a start of surprise
that her beautiful cousin wore a thin red girdle about
her waist.</p>

<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>THE BAYING OF THE HOUNDS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For a moment or two Dorothea lost all track
of the animated conversation on all sides of
her, then she became aware that the company
were getting up from the table.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do hope,” she heard Mrs. May saying, “that
we are not going to begin to see spies wherever we
look. All this silly talk of Red Strings is the product
of some one’s imagination. I don’t believe there
is any such society. It’s absurd.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall not cease to wear a red band about my
throat, yet,” Miss Imogene remarked lightly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course it’s foolish to think that everybody
who wears a red ribbon is a Red String,” Hal
laughed; “but all the same there is such an organization.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That seemed to end the matter for the time being.
The whole gay party assembled in the great parlors
and presently, one after another, near neighbors began
to drop in. Among these was a Colonel Ransome
of the Confederate Army and he brought news
of another prisoner escaped from Andersonville.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They say the fellow is working north through
Georgia,” he ended. “They sent me word to be
on the lookout for him, so you boys can keep your
eyes open.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t blame any one for escaping from Andersonville!”
exclaimed a Miss Perrine, a pretty Creole
from Baton Rouge, “We passed the prison in the
train. There’s a gibbet at the gate of the stockade
and they haven’t even a roof over their poor heads.
I say it isn’t right! The creatures are more like animals
than men. You could see that they were half
starved.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear young lady,” Colonel Ransome demurred
politely, “sympathy for our enemies does
your heart much credit; but our prisoners are being
treated as well as they deserve.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You wouldn’t like it if our own men were
crowded together in the North as these are here,”
Miss Perrine maintained stoutly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith, these are Yankees!” Val Tracy said with
a laugh. “Can it be that there is any young lady in
the South who is sorry for a Yank under any circumstances?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are some who are not,” April cut in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the same I don’t think it’s fair,” Miss Perrine
insisted. “We don’t have to treat our prisoners
that way. It was pitiful to see their hungry
looks. We threw them some of our lunch, but it fell
short and I suppose they will think we did it on
purpose to tantalize them. I don’t care what anybody
says, they’re human, even if they are hateful
Yanks!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are as well fed as our own soldiers,” April
insisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And that isn’t all of it, either,” Colonel Ransome
explained. “The North has refused to exchange
prisoners, saying that Morgan’s Raiders are
criminals. So it’s really their own fault.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say,” Hal cut in, “let’s stop talking and sing a
bit. I near enough of war all day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They gathered about the piano at this suggestion
and soon were shouting lustily the old songs so dear
to all the South in those days. They began with
“My Maryland,” then came “The Bonny Blue
Flag”; one favorite after another, and Dorothea,
seated near the door, listened with great interest, impressed
by the fervor of the singing. But it was not
till some one called for “Dixie” that she had a real
thrill.</p>

<p class='c012'>“April must sing it, and we’ll join in the chorus,”
cried Val Tracy, and the beautiful girl stood straight
beside the piano and sang with all her heart in her
voice:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Southrons, hear your country call you!</div>
      <div class='line'>Up, lest worse than death befall you!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To arms! To arms! To arms in Dixie!</div>
      <div class='line'>Lo! All the beacon fires are lighted.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let all hearts be now united.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To arms! To arms! To arms in Dixie!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Advance the flag in Dixie</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Hurrah! Hurrah!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For Dixie’s land we take our stand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And live and die for Dixie.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To arms! To arms!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And conquer peace for Dixie.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To arms! To arms!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And conquer peace for Dixie!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The chorus rang strong and true at the end of
each verse and when the last note sounded Val Tracy
cried impetuously:</p>

<p class='c012'>“If only the rascally Yankees could hear you,
Miss April! They’d give up, knowing that we had
such fair ones to spur us on to victory.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile Dorothea watched April with a growing
admiration, but not knowing the words of the
song she could not join in the singing and her
thoughts wandered. Unconsciously she turned toward
a side window, for she had had the vague sensation
of some one looking in; indeed as she glanced
that way a face was pressed against the pane for an
instant. It was the countenance of a man, and so
pale, so haggard was it, that Dorothea nearly cried
out with the sudden sympathy she felt. That the
man, whoever he was, was suffering she had no
doubt. The sunken cheeks and the shock of dark
hair hanging down over the brow, threw into relief
the thin white features appearing, as if out of a
mist, against the blackness of the night. Only for a
second did she see it, and then it vanished.</p>

<p class='c012'>Instantly Dorothea’s thoughts flew to Colonel Ransome’s
news of the Yankee prisoner escaped from
the dreadful prison at Andersonville. Her first impulse
had been to call Harriot’s attention, but she
curbed her tongue. The man did not appear to be in
uniform, but when she stopped to think of the matter,
she could not be sure of that. So momentary
had been her glimpse of him that, had she not known
herself to be awake, she might have convinced herself
that she dreamed. She looked about her to note
whether any one else had seen the intruder. But the
others were still shouting at the top of their lungs,
unmindful of all else, carried away with the fervor
of their patriotism and love for the cause in which
they believed with their whole hearts. None had
seen the face at the window. At least, so far, the
man was safe; and surely, if he was an escaped
prisoner, as Dorothea was now convinced, he would
know from the singing at what sort of a house he
had stopped.</p>

<p class='c012'>She then began to speculate upon the poor fellow’s
chances. She wondered if he were hungry and felt
sure, from his face, that he was. She could do nothing
to get him food, but perhaps some money might
help him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, if I could only do something for the poor
soul,” she thought to herself and, on the impulse, rose
to her feet and slipped out into the hall unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had no very clear idea of just what she wanted
to do. Her action was wholly governed by the sympathy
aroused by the man’s evident suffering. She
opened the front door and ran lightly along the gallery
until she came to the end of it, then peered round
the corner toward the window where she had seen
the face. The illumination inside had not been so
bright that her eyes did not quickly accustom themselves
to the darkness without, but she rubbed them
to be sure that she was not mistaken, for there was
no one in sight. In reality the time that had passed
between her first glimpse of the mysterious man and
her search for him was so very short that it was hard
to believe that the stranger had vanished so quickly;
however he was nowhere to be seen and, for his own
sake, Dorothea dared not go farther.</p>

<p class='c012'>Instead she turned swiftly to slip back into the
house, but in so doing she ran into a figure hurrying
along the gallery.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” she cried involuntarily, stepping aside.
For an instant she could not see who it was. “Is it
you, April?” she asked, dimly making out her
cousin’s figure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” came the answer, after a moment’s hesitation.
“I—I—what are you doing here, Dorothea?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The English girl was not minded to explain, yet
she disliked concealing the truth. On the other hand
to tell this fanatical Southern girl that she believed
an escaped prisoner had been there would be to put
the man in jeopardy at once. A hue and cry after
the poor fellow would be started, and Dorothea
would do a good deal to avoid that. In the end she
was not forced to answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorothea,” April said breathlessly, coming
nearer and lowering her voice, “please go in, and
don’t tell any one that I am out here. Please go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Without a word Dorothea went, slipped back into
her place unnoticed, but she was vastly puzzled over
April’s mysterious action, for it was impossible to
believe that her Rebel cousin could have anything to
do with an escaping Yankee prisoner. She shook
her head as other explanations crowded in upon her,
finding no satisfactory solution to the puzzle.</p>

<p class='c012'>When at last her good-nights were said and Dorothea
was back in her room making ready for bed, she
quickly dismissed Lucy and sat down in front of the
fire, her thoughts filled with the day’s experiences.</p>

<p class='c012'>That her welcome had been a hearty and a loving
one she had no doubt. For her own part she felt a
growing affection for these American relatives; but
she was still greatly perplexed to find herself in the
midst of so much gayety and laughter during a
fiercely fought war. The face she had seen at the
window was so filled with misery that the cheerfulness
of her surroundings seemed, not quite right and
brought back to her mind a vivid recollection of the
wretchedness she had witnessed on her brief passage
through the Confederate Army. Could it be that
those behind the Southern fighting line did not care
what was happening to their soldiers?</p>

<p class='c012'>She shook her head in denial of this possibility
and was still puzzling the matter when there came
a gentle knock at her door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come in,” she whispered, and Harriot tiptoed
into the room with a plate of goober pralines in her
hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“April would say we should be in bed,” she announced
in an undertone with a glance at the wall
between the two rooms; “but when she has girls
staying with her, she thinks it’s all right if they sit
up half the night, gossiping and giggling and eating
pralines. She thinks we’re children,” she ended in
a tone of disgust.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, we’re growing up,” said Dorothea
philosophically. “I’m nearly as tall as she is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I had to have a band put around my skirts
I’ve grown so,” Harriot declared with a hint of
pride. “They’ve been let down till there isn’t any
more material left to let!”</p>

<p class='c012'>While Harriot was speaking Dorothea had become
aware of a strange and menacing sound afar
off.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Harriot,” she murmured, “what is that
queer noise?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s the hounds!” Harriot answered after a
moment. “They’re out after some one, and they
seem to be getting nearer.” She jumped up and,
putting out the light, ran to the window.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hounds?” questioned Dorothea, going quickly
to her side. “Do you mean dogs?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, of course,” Harriot replied. “They’re
out after some one. They use the hounds to track
servants who run away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would they use them to find that Yankee
prisoner who had escaped?” Dorothea asked a little
breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, they’re sure to. Maybe that’s who they
<i>are</i> after. Listen! They are coming nearer—I
think I can hear horses galloping.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Undoubtedly the noises of the man-hunt were
louder and Dorothea felt a clutch of pain at her
heart. Was the poor man she saw at the window
that night to be caught by hounds? She shuddered
at the thought.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>INCREASING MYSTERY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The baying of hounds and at length the rapid
tread of horses’ hoofs reached their ears,
growing more distinct each instant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are coming this way,” Harriot murmured
under her breath.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why should they come here?” Dorothea demanded,
beginning to feel more and more apprehensive.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose somebody’s servant has run away,”
Harriot answered, a little reluctantly. “Not ours,”
she hastened to add. “Our people wouldn’t run
away for anything. They’re too well treated.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then there are some that aren’t well treated?”
Dorothea’s tone was more coldly judicial than she
knew.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, of course there are mean men everywhere,”
Harriot explained. “Father says the worst treated
servants are those that are owned by other negroes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By other negroes,” Dorothea echoed in amazement.
“You mean that there are blacks who have
slaves?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot nodded indifferently. This was no new
idea to her and she could not quite understand Dorothea’s
surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, there isn’t anything a negro would rather
have than a slave of his own,” she remarked.
“Father says there are African tribes that were
slave-owners long before—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but they are savages and don’t know any
better,” Dorothea interrupted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Both girls entirely lost the significance of this remark,
for by this time a company of horsemen had
galloped into the May place and were pulling up on
the drive.</p>

<p class='c012'>The cousins, looking out of the window, could see
the forms of mounted men and huge dogs moving
here and there across the lawns below them. The
low whines of the eager hounds as they snuffed about
could be heard above the murmured talk among the
men and the restless trampling of the horses.
Whether these great beasts, trained for man-hunting,
were after a slave or an escaping Union soldier
she as yet did not know; but in either case it seemed
a very horrible proceeding to Dorothea, and by so
much her sympathy for the Southern cause was weakened.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her thoughts were interrupted by a thundering
knock at the front door, which echoed through the
house, and in a moment there was a murmur of voices
growing increasingly distinct. Hal May and Val
Tracy could be heard talking earnestly to a stranger,
but in so low a tone that the girls could not make out
what it was all about. On either side of them,
however, windows were opening and they knew that
all the other members of the household were on the
alert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I wish I were dressed!” Harriot cried,
fidgeting about impatiently. “I wonder what they
want here, anyway? They know we wouldn’t help
to run off anybody’s servants. I’m going to slip
something on and go down.” She ran out of the
room, leaving Dorothea alone at the window.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ladies,” came the voice of Val Tracy as he
stepped out on the lawn and called up to those at
the windows above the gallery, “these gentlemen
are out after a Yankee officer who has escaped from
Andersonville. We have assured them that none of
us has seen any one lurking about the place, but they
insist that the fugitive was traced here and that they
will feel more content if we inquire of you ladies
whether or not you have seen anything out of the
ordinary to-night?”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was silence for a moment and in that short
space of time Dorothea’s mind was busy. She had
no intention of volunteering any information as to
what she had seen. She was convinced now of the
correctness of her first impression—that the face
she had beheld for a moment was that of the escaping
officer. But instantly her thoughts flew again
to April: Her cousin’s distinct surprise at finding
her out on the porch; her evident confusion and her
final injunction to Dorothea not to say anything to
the others of having seen her; all these things pointed
to one explanation.</p>

<p class='c012'>April knew as well as she that there was some one
outside the house that night.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why,” Dorothea speculated to herself,
“should April shield a Yankee officer who was escaping?”
and instantly she remembered the thin band
of red in her cousin’s girdle and the “Red Strings”
of whom Hal had told them that night.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can April be a ‘Red String’?” she asked herself.
“Impossible!” she answered. April never
lost an opportunity to proclaim her loyalty or to condemn
the Yankees whom she apparently hated. Yet
to seem excessively loyal would be the best way to
keep her secret if she had one, was the next conclusion
Dorothea reached—and this thought seemed
to her an explanation of many things.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At least I shan’t tell anything, if I don’t have
to,” she concluded and so waited for the next words
from out of the darkness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No one saw anybody, I’m sure,” she heard Mrs.
May calling down to those on the lawn. “The
hounds must have followed the wrong scent, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Were any of you ladies outside the house during
the evening?” asked Val Tracy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here was a direct question that seemed to Dorothea
aimed at her. Still, she held her tongue.
April, as well as she, had been out and she waited
for her cousin to answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I saw Miss Drummond go out on the gallery,”
came the gentle voice of Miss Perrine. “Of course
I don’t say she saw anything, and probably she has
forgotten she went out, but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was on the porch with Dorothea,” April cut in,
“and I saw no one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But did Dorothea see any one?” Hal demanded
out of the darkness.</p>

<p class='c012'>It seemed to her that the time had come when she
must answer and she could not bring herself to lie
deliberately. She hoped that the man she had seen
was now far enough away to escape; but, whatever
came of the matter, she could not deny that she
had seen him if the direct question was put to her.
Greatly to her surprise a voice beside her answered
the question for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorothea may have seen the same face at the
window I saw.” Dorothea turned and found beside
her the figure of Miss Imogene, who had come into
the room so silently that she had not noticed her till
that minute.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then there was somebody!” cried a strange
voice. “Where did he go?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Back to the quarters, I reckon,” Miss Imogene
answered calmly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Back to the quarters!” was the disappointed
murmur from below.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We were singing and the negroes are always
attracted by music,” Miss Imogene explained; but
at the same moment she put an arm about Dorothea’s
waist and drew her close to her. The girl felt instinctively
an effort on the part of both Miss Imogene
and April to intervene before she was forced to
speak. She could not see the reasons for this. She
was perplexed and puzzled at such evasion, but it
satisfied her to remain silent, though why either of
them should wish to shield an escaping Yankee was
a mystery.</p>

<p class='c012'>At that moment one of the great hounds lifted up
its head and bayed dismally and in an instant the
others, their noses close to the ground, made for the
spot and joined in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They’ve found the scent again,” some one cried.
“Come on, men. If our bird was here he’s gone on!”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a hurried beat of horses’ hoofs as their
riders wheeled and started at a gallop behind the
dogs.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sorry to have disturbed you, ladies,” came the
voice of the leader out of the darkness, “but we
have to catch this Yankee!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The sounds of their rapid movements grew fainter
and fainter and finally ceased as the men drew away.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last all was silent again. And all the while
Dorothea had stood beside Miss Imogene, wondering
if the man she had seen would be taken, puzzled
by the strange conflict and mystery which she felt
surrounded her, getting no reasonable explanation
for this obvious intervention by April and Miss
Imogene to keep her in the background.</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman beside her shivered a little and a long
sigh escaped her lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m cold, child,” she murmured, and releasing
Dorothea went to the fire and held her tiny hands
to the dying blaze.</p>

<p class='c012'>The girl herself felt a chill in the air and, closing
the window, went to the hearth for warmth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shall I put on another log, Miss Imogene?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do, honey,” said the elder woman; “I don’t
know whether it’s my nerves or the night air, but I
haven’t felt so chilly for a long time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea put on another stick of wood and sat
down at Miss Imogene’s feet, watching while the
fire kindled. It was plain that her companion was
overwrought and she herself had no desire to talk.
Her brain kept going over and over again the
puzzling points in the night’s experience and she
could make neither head nor tail out of it all. Nor
could she rid herself of the horror of these great
dogs tearing across the country while the vision of
the haggard face she had seen at the window still
haunted her. Would they catch him at last?
Would these mouthing hounds surround the poor
fellow, perhaps in some swamp where he had fled,
half dead with privations and hunger, to escape
them? She, too, shivered at the thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it, dear?” asked Miss Imogene, bending
down to the girl at her feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t help thinking of that poor man they are
after,” she answered in a low tone. “It seems so
awful to hunt human beings with dogs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t worry,” Miss Imogene consoled her. “I
don’t think they will catch <i>this</i> prisoner from Andersonville.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the dogs, Miss Imogene, they were on the
track,” Dorothea replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“On the wrong track, my dear,” the elder lady
answered, with a nervous little chuckle. “The
wrong track.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how do you know?” demanded Dorothea,
turning to look up into the face of Miss Imogene
alight in the now blazing fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For a woman’s reason, ‘because,’” the other
answered evasively but with a bright smile as she
stood up. “I must go back to bed, honey, and I
advise you to stop thinking about runaway Yankees
and get your beauty sleep.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Without another word Dorothea accompanied
her visitor to the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-night, honey,” said Miss Imogene, kissing
the girl with a genuine warmth. “We are going to
be good friends, for I love you already, my child.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea closed the door behind her without a
word. Once more her thoughts flew back to the matters
that had been puzzling her all the evening.
Miss Imogene wore a red band of velvet around her
throat. Was she a “Red String”? The girl went
back to the fire and seated herself once more in front
of it, her eyes gazing into the flames leaping up the
chimney, and her thoughts going over and over again
the experiences of this first night in her new home.</p>

<p class='c012'>But not yet had she come to the end of her perplexities.
She heard voices whispering in the hall
and then there came again a soft tapping on her door.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea guessed that it was April, and was not
surprised when her beautiful cousin came in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must talk to you a moment, Dorothea,” April
said, sitting down by the fire. There was something
antagonistic in her manner, though Dorothea could
not say wherein it was displayed. “I did not hear
you say to-night that you had or had not seen anybody
outside the house. Did you see any one?”
The question was direct and, as she asked it, her
eyes fell upon the red band of velvet about Dorothea’s
wrist.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea was at a loss what to reply. She believed
that April was demanding an answer to something
she knew already and could see no motive
for it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I had rather not talk about that, April,” she
answered at last, with a smile. “Can’t we forget
all about it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” answered April, “no, we can’t. You
must remember, Dorothea, that we are at war. You
say your sympathies are with the South. We believe
you, but you seem to have evaded a direct question
and—and—well, I want to know, so that
there will be no doubt in my mind. Did you see
someone?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I did,” Dorothea answered. She felt that
under any circumstances it would do no harm to the
escaping officer if April knew. It was out of her
hands now either to help or hinder the poor prisoner.</p>

<p class='c012'>April’s eyes widened.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did you not tell them?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because,” Dorothea replied firmly, “I did not
have a chance, in the first place, and, in the second,
I was in no hurry to be the means of setting dogs on
a man, whoever he might be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You do not understand these things,” April replied.
“We have no other way of finding prisoners.
But Cousin Imogene said it was one of the negroes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The man I saw was a white man,” Dorothea
answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then he was the one who escaped from Andersonville,”
April said, her voice rising a little. “You
have helped a Yankee to escape! That is not the
action or one who is in sympathy with the South.”
Again her eyes sought the red velvet band about
Dorothea’s wrist.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It may have been a Yankee,” Dorothea confessed,
calmly. “I certainly thought so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you were deliberately silent?” April spoke
angrily. “You let one of our enemies get away
when you might have helped to catch him? I tell
you, Dorothea, we can’t stand that. I shall tell
Hal; it may not be too late to get word to the men
who are searching.” She rose to her feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are not fair, April,” the other protested,
rising also. “What were <i>you</i> doing on the porch?
You said nothing of seeing any one any more than I
did, and you must have—”</p>

<p class='c012'>April’s eyes widened in surprise for an instant
and then, going close to her cousin, she whispered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What was the man like, Dorothea?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I only saw his face for a moment but it was very
pale and haggard,” Dorothea answered. “His hair
was dark and there was a long lock that came down
over his forehead. I think, too, that there was a
small mole on his cheek, but that might have been
a spot of mud. I can’t tell you—”</p>

<p class='c012'>She stopped abruptly, seeing a great change in
her cousin’s face. April had lost her look of anger
and in its place there was an expression of profound
sorrow, and her beautiful eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was mistaken, Dorothea,” she faltered, half
choking with some hidden emotion. “Forgive
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She turned away and hurried out of the room,
while Dorothea stood for a moment, gazing at the
shut door and wondering what would happen next
to deepen the mystery.</p>

<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>THE NEXT MORNING</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dorothea awoke next morning to find Harriot
creeping into her bed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good morning,” she murmured, opening
one sleepy eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hoped I wouldn’t wake you,” said Harriot
briskly, “but, now that you are awake, we might
just as well talk. I wanted to get you first to-day
before the others. You’re going to be mighty popular,
I can see that, and you’re my cousin just as much
as you are April’s.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was under the covers by this time and snuggled
down with a series of comfortable wiggles.</p>

<p class='c012'>The mention of April brought back to Dorothea’s
mind the last glimpse she had had of her beautiful
cousin the night before, and the events leading up
to it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder if they caught that poor man,” she
said, all sleep gone from her eyes by this time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I don’t know. I hope not, though you
mustn’t say so to April,” Harriot answered.
“She’s so patriotic and loyal that it hurts her. I
hope I’ll never have any love affairs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean by that?” demanded Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m thinking of April,” Harriot went on.
“She used to be the nicest, sweetest girl you ever
knew and now—she’s a perfect idiot. Yes, she <i>is</i>,
a perfect idiot. You just be warned by April and
never have a love affair if you can help it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But perhaps you can’t help it,” Dorothea suggested
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I mean to,” Harriot insisted. “I shall
never fall in love. I’ve had my warning. It’s awful!
And I like Lee Hendon, too; even if he is a
coward—though some people say he isn’t at all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is he? Tell me about him, won’t you?”
asked Dorothea, thinking perhaps to find an explanation
of April’s actions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There isn’t much to tell,” Harriot replied.
“April’s so terribly pretty that of course she’s had
lots and lots of beaux, and I don’t think any one noticed
much about Lee Hendon—at least I didn’t,
’cause he’s been like a brother to us all his life and—well,
when all the fuss came, there just couldn’t
be any other explanation except that April liked him
better than the others.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What fuss?” asked Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because he didn’t enlist when the war broke
out,” Harriot explained.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is he an Abolitionist?” Dorothea questioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, my, no! It would be almost better if he
were. That would be a good reason for the way
he’s acting—not just ’cause he’s afraid, as ’most
everybody says. No, it isn’t because he’s an Abolitionist.
He and his mother have three plantations
and lots and lots of servants. At first, you know,
a man who had twenty slaves didn’t have to enlist—though
of course <i>gentlemen</i> didn’t wait to be made.
My father and Hal went, right off; and so did ’most
every one else. Then after a while the news went
’round that Lee Hendon hadn’t gone and wasn’t
going. Oh, there was a lot of talk, and he sort of
kept away as much as he could, till finally the girls
sent him a Secession bonnet and a crinoline and
skirt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then what did he do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I don’t know,” Harriot answered. “Nothing,
I reckon. But Dr. Hardesty told everybody
that it was Lee’s mother who kept him at home.
That she was mighty sick and if he went away she’d
surely die. The doctor said we ought to admire
Lee for not deserting his mother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should have thought that would have satisfied
April,” Dorothea suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing would satisfy her except that he should
go and fight,” answered Harriot. “But he
wouldn’t, and we heard he had paid a substitute
three hundred dollars. That was the last straw.
It’s that sort of thing makes people say this is a
‘Rich man’s war but a poor man’s fight,’ and April
cut him, on the steps of the church one Sunday morning,
and she hasn’t spoken of him since. All the
same she keeps thinking about him, or else why is
she so queer?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t think she was queer,” Dorothea remarked
after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s because you don’t know how she used to
be,” Harriot replied. “Before, she used to laugh
all the time and—oh, I don’t know, but she wasn’t
so dreadfully grown-up and we had lots of fun together.
Now she acts just like she loved going to
Mothers’ Meetings and sewing and all that kind of
thing. You wouldn’t understand, ’cause you didn’t
know her before, but I tell you she’s mighty
changed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As if she had exhausted the topic of conversation
Harriot snuggled down further under the covers
and the first thing Dorothea knew her young
cousin was fast asleep. Soon Dorothea herself
drifted off into another nap, to be aroused a little
later by hearing a soft puffing sound and a low-voiced
humming in the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>She lifted her head and there, before the fire,
blowing it gently, was Lucy, her maid, singing softly
to herself.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mary and Marthy feed ma lambs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feed ma lambs, feed ma lambs.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mary and Marthy feed ma lambs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sittin’ on the golden stair.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The verse finished, the colored girl turned her
head and met Dorothea’s glance, whereupon she
smiled broadly and getting to her feet came to the
side of the bed. Dorothea’s sleepy eyes opened
wide as she caught sight of a band of cheap red ribbon
tying back Lucy’s frizzy hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does my little missy want I shall bring her she’s
breakfus’ in baid?” the smiling maid asked. “I’ve
been wrastlin’ with that pesky fire, tryin’ to kindle it
without wakin’ you-all, but I ’spects that wood done
come from a tree what was lightnin’ struck, it ac’ so
contrary.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t wake Miss Harriot,” Dorothea cautioned
in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothin’ don’t wake Miss Harry till she’s ready
to be woked,” Lucy assured her. “Her old mammy
always done said she was the sleepin’est and the
eatin’est baby she ever set her two eyes on—and
Miss Harry ain’t outgrow it none.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But hadn’t I better go down to breakfast with
my aunt?” Dorothea asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Land sakes, honey,” Lucy replied with a wide
grin. “Ol’ Miss had she’s breakfus’ hours and
hours ago. She don’t spressify what you must do.
But ev’ybody pleases they’ se’f heah, and that please
Ol’ Miss.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And then Harriot suddenly woke up. To Dorothea’s
mind she did this, not like a person rousing
from a deep sleep, but rather like a wax doll whose
eyes come open with a snap and who is suddenly
wide awake.</p>

<p class='c012'>Something of this she expressed to Harriot, who
seemed rather annoyed thereby.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t see anything in that to make a fuss
about,” she said, with a pout. “When I’m done
sleeping, I’m done, and so I stop. When you’ve
done eating no one expects you to go on chewing for
an hour, do they? Now I want breakfast right
away. We’ve lots to do this morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy was at once dispatched for plenty of food
for two, and then Dorothea inquired what was the
pressing business a-foot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“First thing, I must show you to my Cousin
Corinne,” Harriot explained. “You’ll be a terrible
disappointment to her. She thinks she’s the
only cousin I have handy, and she’s always bragging
to me about the Polks and the Morgans, who are
kin to her but not to me. So I want you to put on
a very pretty dress and I’ll make Uncle Jastrow
harness up and drive us over there in style, just like
you were too proud to walk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this juncture the breakfast arrived and as Lucy
set the tray upon the bed she implored the girls to
be careful and not spill the salt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it so precious?” asked Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, missy, ’tain’t that,” Lucy explained, “but
land sakes, honey, it’s most powerful bad luck.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t believe in bad luck,” she insisted, at
which Lucy threw up her hands in horror.</p>

<p class='c012'>Even in this time of scarcity Aunt Decent had sent
up food enough for three or four girls, though Harriot
grumbled because there were no beaten biscuits,
and brought the announcement from Lucy that white
flour was so scarce that they were saving what was
left for sick folks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“An’ youh ma she say if ever again she see the
full of a bar’l of white flour at one time she’s gwin’
to give a party. Youh ma’s mammy she took
mighty good care to open up she’s hands an put
somepin’ in ’em when she was a baby. So, nach’ly
you ma she ain’t close-fisted, nohow. What she’s
got, she shares.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Notwithstanding this lack of white biscuits the
girls managed to make a very satisfactory meal, after
which Harriot slipped into her dressing-gown to
go back to her own room. But Dorothea stopped
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve a lovely idea,” she cried suddenly. “Why
don’t you wear one of my dresses and hats when we
go to call on Corinne?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot seized on this suggestion with avidity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She might think we were strangers and give us
fruit cake,” she suggested. “No one can make
fruit cake like Aunt Dilsey, even now she has nothing
to make it of.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea’s dress being long for Harriot gave her
a more mature look, which led naturally to rearranging
her hair and she was very shortly a quite
grown-up Harriot who at once assumed airs to fit
her fine raiment. Lucy, vastly entertained by these
plans, lent her quick fingers to the task and when it
was finished expressed herself satisfied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Foh de land’s sake, Miss Harry!” she cried,
stepping back to view her handiwork, “yoh sure is
prettier than I eveh thought yoh could be. Lil’ Miss
betteh look out for she’s beaux when you done come
along dressed up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be foolish,” Harriot retorted, but she was
pleased, nevertheless. The fact was that her dress
of green cashmere with a sacque and hat of deeper
hue were most becoming and she made a charming
picture.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come,” said Dorothea, “I want to show you
off to Aunt Parthenia.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But at this Harriot demurred.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mother’s apt to be mighty busy,” she objected.
“Wait till we come back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She sent Lucy off with an order that Uncle Jastrow
should harness up the carriage and drive them himself
to go calling in state. Then they went down
stairs to await their chariot. But when it came,
Simeon was handling the reins. He was quite embarrassed
and very apologetic for his lack of magnificence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Uncle Jastrow?” demanded Harriot,
bristling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please, Miss Harry,” Simeon answered, “I
knows I ain’t got no style, but Uncle Jastrow done
say I was ’bliged to drive.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why?” Harriot insisted. “Is Uncle Jastrow
sick?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No’m, he ain’t sick ezackly,” Simeon replied,
“but he say, please, Miss Harry, won’t you kindly
be so good as not to blame him; but what with the
horses quality company has rid off with to-day, and
the horses Ol’ Miss done sent on errants, not to
speak of the horses General Wheeler’s men pressed,
they ain’t nothin’ lef’ in the stables ’ceptin ’tis ole
Mose; An’ Uncle Jastrow he say he done kep’ his
moanin’s to hisself when he come down f’om the
granjure of four horses to drivin’ only two, knowin’
the war was makin’ us all sort of equinomical; but
he can’t no way bemean hisself to one. He say yoh
pa hisself wouldn’t ask him to hol’ the reins over
only ole Mose, an’ he ain’t gwine’ disgrace the
fambly that a-way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” said Harriot, turning to Dorothea,
“it does seem sort of humiliating for Uncle Jastrow,
seeing what he’s used to driving. And I reckon he’s
right about father. But he’s too proud of himself
for all that. You would think that if we’re not too
grand to ride behind old Mose he might be able
to drive him. But come along. We’ll never get
there if we don’t start pretty soon. I haven’t time
to argue with Uncle Jastrow till we get back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The girls entered the carriage and Simeon, summoning
all the style of which he was possessed,
whipped up old Mose and they drove off.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is Uncle Jastrow a slave?” asked Dorothea,
considerably puzzled by what she had seen and
heard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish you wouldn’t say ‘slave’ as if you expected
our people to walk about loaded with chains,”
Harriot remarked judicially. “That’s what comes
of reading ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin.’ Mother says the
horrid Yankees call their servants ‘help’ just to be
different from us. Of course Uncle Jastrow is one
of our servants, but he’s so spoiled that he does just
exactly what he wants. He bosses me and he bosses
mother, and father just laughs at him. April’s the
only one can manage him. You know it’s difficult
to be dignified with an old man who knew you when
you were a baby and can tell you just how fat you
were.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As they rolled along through the sunshine a more
peaceful scene could hardly be imagined. No one
seeing these two pretty girls in fashionable attire,
driven along the quiet road by a neat black coachman,
even though it was behind the despised ‘Ole Mose,’
would ever have thought they were living in a country
engaged in a deadly war.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not a long journey, and soon they came to
the home of Mr. Charles Stewart, where Simeon,
with his best imitation of Uncle Jastrow’s grand
manner, encouraged old Mose till he trotted up the
driveway like a skittish colt. A little darky, on
the watch for just such arrivals, sprang to the carriage
and placed a cover over the wheel, and the
two girls descended in state, spreading their gowns
and preening themselves like peacocks.</p>

<p class='c012'>But they had little chance to make an impression,
for the front door was thrown hastily open and
Corinne appeared, much excited.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you think, Harriot?” she cried, taking
no notice of either Dorothea or their finery;
“Pa has just sent us word that the hateful English
have repudiated the South. Whatever do you
suppose we are going to do now?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Afterward Dorothea thought how curious
it was that Corinne’s complaint of the “hateful
English” had annoyed her so little. At
the time she only felt abashed that the plans to surprise
Harriot’s cousin with their finery seemed to
have fallen flat. Indeed, Corinne’s announcement
was a good deal like a dash of cold water in her
guests’ faces; but she was evidently so much impressed
by this latest war news that she could think
of nothing else. It was as if she did not see Dorothea
at all, and was for going on excitedly when
Harriot cut her short rather tartly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Corinne, this is my cousin, Dorothea Drummond,”
she explained. “Her father is English, but
she’s for the South no matter what their Government
may do. And anyway it is our duty to be polite to
the stranger within our gates.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Corinne smiled on Dorothea and for the first
time seemed to realize that the girls before her deserved
a more careful scrutiny. “I’m so glad
you’ve come to visit us,” she said, pleasantly enough,
but quite formally. “I’m afraid you will find us
very much upset since the war and quite behind the
fashion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hadn’t noticed it,” Dorothea answered with
a glance at Harriot, who switched her wide skirt
so that her cousin could not fail to observe it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Corinne, by this time, had begun to realize that
this was no ordinary visit and her eyes widened as
she grasped the magnificence of Harriot’s apparel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see Miss Drummond has been running the
blockade,” she remarked by no means cordially.
“And you seem to have grown up very fast, Harriot.
You know,” she went on, turning to Dorothea with
her most patronizing air, “we always think of Harriot
as a little girl who cares more for cakes and
candy than anything else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If this was said to embarrass her cousin it had
quite the opposite effect.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, that reminds me. Where is Aunt Cora?”
she asked with an eager tone in her voice. “I think
she wants to see us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My mother is much upset over this news from
England,” Corinne replied rather severely, making
no move to invite them into the house. “You don’t
seem to comprehend the importance of it, Harriot.
What we are going to do now that the British have
refused to let us fit out vessels in their ports I don’t
see. You understand, don’t you, Miss Drummond?”
She asked the question as if it was hardly
to be expected that the youthful Harriot could appreciate
so mature a matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course she understands and so do I,” Harriot
answered promptly. “But we’ll get on somehow.
England is not the only country in the world.
You don’t suppose our great Confederacy is so easy
to defeat as that, do you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Our great Confederacy!’” Corinne wailed.
“They’ve insulted us by calling it the ‘so-called
Confederacy,’ as if it was nothing and we hadn’t
any right to it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think it matters what they call it,” Dorothea
remarked, trying to seem sympathetic. She
could not help feeling that Corinne lacked sincerity
and that she was just repeating, parrot-like, what she
had heard others say.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on, let’s go in,” Harriot said, moving
toward the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, do come in.” Corinne’s invitation was
not enthusiastic, but Harriot, at least, cared nothing
for that. “Ma will want to see you. She’s having
a trying time making up her mind what things
she ought to take with her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take with her?” echoed Harriot, standing in
the doorway. “Where’s she going?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She doesn’t quite know,” Corinne returned.
“Either to Mexico or Brazil. She hasn’t decided
yet, but now that the South is beaten there isn’t any
place in this country for ladies and gentlemen to live.
At least that’s what Ma says.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fiddlesticks!” Harriot muttered, and marched
into the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>They found Mrs. Stewart in the parlor, sewing as
if her life depended upon her speed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Harriot, my love, I’m overjoyed to see you,”
she greeted her niece in a tearful voice, hardly looking
up from her work. “I’m making a running bag
to tie inside my hoops. I shall put my diamonds
in it when I go to Mexico. I suppose your mother
has everything ready to leave?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, no, Aunt Cora,” Harriot replied, going
over and kissing the cheek upturned for her salute.
“We hadn’t heard of this English insult, but I don’t
think it will make any difference to us. I’ve brought
my cousin, Dorothea Drummond, to call on you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you do, my dear,” Mrs. Stewart murmured,
stopping long enough to look up at Dorothea
and hold out a couple of fingers. “You come among
us in sad days. I don’t know when we shall start,
but it can’t be long now. Do you know anything
about Brazil, by any chance?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea confessed that she did not.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It seems very hard to find anybody that does,”
Mrs. Stewart went on, in the same melancholy way.
“And yet Brazil is quite a well-known place, I’m
told. And it certainly sounds more interesting than
Mexico. It makes me think of birds, though I
don’t know why. However, we shall soon be flitting
somewhere like the birds. And there’s so much to
be done. I was going to bury the silver yesterday;
but then it occurred to me that I would have to dig
up the whole garden to hide the spot from the negroes,
and I really didn’t feel equal to it last night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aunt Cora,” Harriot cried, “how can you say
such things? You’ll give Dorothea such a wrong
impression. You know our servants are all loyal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Stewart wagged her head doubtfully over
her sewing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m not so certain, honey,” she insisted. “They
have grown very insolent of late—but what’s the
difference now? My only trouble is that I can’t
make sure where we shall find the best society, in
Brazil or in Mexico. I had made up my mind to
London, but of course that’s out of the question
now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should think it was!” Corinne cut in sharply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t fancy you’d find the society in London
much changed,” Dorothea could not refrain from
remarking.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps not,” Mrs. Stewart replied doubtfully,
“but it would never be the same to me. Under the
circumstances I should not care to grace the London
drawing rooms—not after the news we have just
received. But let us forget our troubles for a while
if we can. Ring the bell, honey,” she went on to
her daughter, “and order cake and wine. There
is just one comfort I shall get out of this. I shall
not hoard any longer. When I leave Washington
I don’t intend to leave anything behind me for the
beggarly Yankees to eat or drink.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot nudged Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fruit cake,” she whispered as Corinne pulled
the bell rope. Aloud she said, “I don’t see, Aunt
Cora, what difference this English news makes. We
all know that one Southerner is worth ten Yankees.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you really think so, my dear?” her Aunt
asked anxiously. “In that case perhaps I’d better
not be so lavish. Corinne, you might go with Alice.
Give her a glass of scuppernong wine for each of
us and some seed cakes. I’ll save the fruit cake a
little longer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She handed her daughter the keys to the store-room
and Dorothea could scarcely contain her laughter
at the sight of Harriot’s disgusted face as she
watched Corinne hurry out of the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you ever think, Mrs. Stewart,” Dorothea
began mischievously, “of quilting gold coins into a
petticoat? They say you can carry a great deal of
money that way and never be suspected.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At once Mrs. Stewart’s fears were revived.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is a very good idea, my dear,” she commented.
“Harriot, my love, run and tell Corinne
to bring us the fruit cake after all. We had much
better enjoy it than have the Yankees gobbling it
up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot did not wait to hear the end of the sentence.
She was not minded to tarry and give her
aunt an opportunity to change her mind once more.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Honey,” Mrs. Stewart began at once, the moment
they were alone, “I sent Harriot away with
Corinne on purpose. I have had some news that
I am at a loss to know how to break to the family,
and perhaps you can make some suggestion. It is
not a matter to be gossiped about. Mrs. Hendon
was buried yesterday afternoon!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She stopped and looked at Dorothea as if she expected
some demonstration of overwhelming surprise
on the part of the young girl.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that Mr. Lee Hendon’s mother?” Dorothea
asked calmly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, my dear,” came the hurried answer.
“You’ve heard of the situation with April, of
course? You couldn’t be in the town five minutes
without hearing of it, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I have heard of it,” said Dorothea.
“Now that his poor mother is dead, everything will
be all right, won’t it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You would think so, wouldn’t you?” Mrs. Stewart
hurried on, “but that’s the awkward part of
it. President Davis has passed a law that every
white man of proper age who doesn’t report for
military duty is liable to death as a deserter. You
see what that means?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, I don’t,” Dorothea confessed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, my love, it’s plain enough,” Mrs. Stewart
explained, as if to a very stupid child. “Lee Hendon
never went back home from his mother’s grave
after the funeral yesterday afternoon. He has disappeared
completely. No one knows where he is—and
there can be only one explanation.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You mean he has disappeared in order not to
fight for the South?” Dorothea asked earnestly.
She remembered the face she had seen at the window
the night before and now realized the reason for the
agony it expressed. He was alone, this poor Lee
Hendon, with whom she had instinctively sympathized
when first she had heard of him. He had
stopped to see his sweetheart for the last time and
then— But here her thoughts came to a sudden
stop. April had been on the porch, too, last night.
Of a sudden Dorothea thought she saw a clear explanation
of all that had seemed mysterious to her.
April was not a “Red String” after all. The
lovers had met and parted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“April must be told,” she heard Mrs. Stewart
saying, “and I don’t know how the news is to be
broken to her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was on the tip of Dorothea’s tongue to say
that Mrs. Stewart need not worry about April’s
knowing it; but instead she suggested speaking to
Mrs. May as soon as she returned to the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think we had better go back as soon as possible,”
she ended. “Aunt Parthenia will know exactly
what to do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have an old head on young shoulders,”
Mrs. Stewart said approvingly. “Call me ‘Aunt
Cora,’ dear—though I shan’t be here long. I
knew I should love you the moment I saw you.”
On the instant she seemed to have forgotten April’s
affairs and was back again on her own perplexities.
“Do you think I might manage two running bags?”
she went on, looking up with a wrinkled forehead
as if the decision was a most momentous one. “Perhaps
two would be too heavy. Still my hoops are
good and wide and I’ve just had them repaired.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea gravely advised her about the bags.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I go to Brazil,” Mrs. Stewart continued fretfully,
“perhaps I’d better leave my diamonds and
take my other jewelry instead. Diamonds are very
common in Brazil, they tell me. Every one has
them. They grow them there, I think; but I’m not
sure of that. And then there’s the matter of the
climate. No one seems to know what it’s really like.
I wonder if Lee Hendon could possibly have gone
there?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea held up a warning finger. She heard
the voices of the girls returning, and Mrs. Stewart,
understanding, changed the subject at once without
in the least changing the note of her complaining
voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, war is war,” she rambled on; “but
what I always said from the first was that no one had
any right to begin it unless they were sure they
could win, and at the least they should have shown
enough foresight to investigate the best places for
us to go if we lost. A wise government would have
let us all know whether Brazil or Mexico was the
right place. But no! Nothing of that sort has
been done, and the matter is left to the ladies to
settle. However, whichever way I decide, your
father, Corinne, will think we had better go to the
other place.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t believe Uncle Charlie will want to go
away at all,” Harriot remarked placidly, munching
a piece of cake. “I don’t see why he shouldn’t
stay right here the same as before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And do his own work like a common Yankee?”
cried Corinne scornfully. “You forget that all the
servants will be gone. I’d rather go to Brazil.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You might pay the servants as we do in England,”
Dorothea suggested. “Papa says it is much
cheaper in the end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear, how original!” Mrs. Stewart remarked,
sewing at top speed. “Children, I hope
you will give heed to your cousin. She has quite a
mind, quite a mind indeed. Of course I don’t see
how we can house the servants and clothe them and
feed them and pay them, too; but I’ll certainly mention
it to your Uncle Charles.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She stopped abruptly to thread her needle and it
was as if a river had suddenly ceased its soothing
murmur.</p>

<p class='c012'>A little later, Harriot having consumed the last
piece of cake, the girls took their departure with
promises to see each other soon again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you think,” Harriot said under her
breath, when they were well away from the house,
“Lee Hendon’s mother is dead and he’s run away!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, how did you know that?” demanded
Dorothea, thinking or Mrs. Stewart’s secrecy in the
matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Corinne told me,” Harriot explained. “Aunt
Cora doesn’t know and I didn’t want to tell her, because
she’ll blab to everybody she sees, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, she told me,” Dorothea said, calmly.
“She didn’t want you to know till I had told Aunt
Parthenia.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well!” cried the outraged Harriot. “I like
that! As if I couldn’t keep a secret better than Aunt
Cora. At any rate, I don’t see why it should be
made such a mystery. April will be the last person
in the town to find it out. No one will tell her,
of course.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea turned and looked out across the country
through which they were slowly driving. She
was quite sure in her own mind that there would be
no need of any one’s telling April about Lee Hendon.</p>

    <div>A KNOCK ON THE WINDOW</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>By the time the girls had arrived at the May
house once more they had reached the conclusion
that Harriot should speak to her
mother about Mrs. Hendon’s death. Mrs. May
could then determine whether she wanted to tell
April or not.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, if she learns about it,” Harriot said
thoughtfully, “it’ll spoil April’s good time at the
party to-night, though you would never guess it.
She’d just be gayer than ever. But mother will
know what’s best to do about that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea agreed that this was the wisest procedure
and kept her own thoughts on the matter to
herself. She had no wish to complicate an already
delicate situation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the news from England won’t help to make
the party a very gay one, I’m afraid,” she remarked
a little later.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, don’t notice Corinne’s foolishness; we
wouldn’t let any one think we cared about <i>that</i>,”
Harriot replied scornfully. “If it is true that England
won’t recognize us any more, we can’t help it;
but we won’t stop fighting. We’ll fight all the
harder. We aren’t going to sit down and cry over
it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea, having grown up among people who
took particular note of the more serious happenings
in the world, had an adequate idea of the seriousness
of this decision of the land of her birth. She
did not believe that Harriot had any comprehension
of how great a difference it would make to the Confederacy
to have the British Government withhold
all help and sympathy from the Southern cause.
She appreciated that while the English people might
still, and probably did, retain the same views upon
the rights and wrongs of this war in America, and
no doubt would continue to wish the South to win,
that would not help rebel ships to refit in English
ports—and where else was the South to go to replenish
her fast disappearing resources?</p>

<p class='c012'>“It <i>must</i> make a difference,” Dorothea thought.
“We shall have a pretty doleful party, in spite of
what Harriot says.” But she let her cousin talk
on about the prospective gayety uncontradicted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” said Harriot, “it won’t be anything
like our parties were before this war began, but
we’ll have a good time all the same and you needn’t
worry about partners.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea had heard a great deal about entertainments
since her arrival the day before and it had
set her wondering. There had been continual talk
of dances to come, and references to balls at this
or that place, until she had realized that nearly
every night was an occasion for some sort of gayety
that continued in spite of the fact that the country
was suffering from want of food and clothing and
that the brave fellows with whom the beautiful girls
danced might lose their lives in battle the next day.
She had not begun to think seriously over this phase
of her new life, but after this news from England
she expected some sign of a depressed spirit and
would not have been surprised to find the evening’s
plans abandoned.</p>

<p class='c012'>The May household did not dress till after supper,
which, in consequence, was a rather scrambled
affair. The men had returned as usual, and there
was the customary banter among them as they sat
about the long table. In the center of this whirl
was April, the leader in all the laughter, and Dorothea
looked at her wonderingly, thinking of Lee
Hendon. Could this bright girl keep up so courageous
a spirit, knowing that her lover was suffering?
Dorothea could scarcely believe it. Either her
cousin did not care for Lee Hendon as was reported,
or else she had met him and had given him the consolation
he stood so much in need of, if he could be
judged from the glimpse she had had of him through
the window.</p>

<p class='c012'>But on her way upstairs to dress she caught sight
of April’s face when her cousin was off her guard,
and it wore a look of misery. Dorothea went
straight to her room, assailed with new doubts, finding
now no explanation that would satisfy against
this evidence of a hidden sorrow.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy was on her knees before the fire, setting slippers
and silk stockings to warm. The pretty colored
girl was vastly proud of her new young lady’s
magnificent possessions. At the moment, however,
she had a grievance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Missy, honey,” she began complainingly, “when
yoh comes in, cain’t yoh ring for Lucy, please, to take
youh hat and sacque?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I don’t always need you, Lucy,” Dorothea
replied with a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Deed, missy, yoh needs me more’n yoh knows
of,” the girl went on. “When I comes up here
what does I find? Youh hat on the baid!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought I could put it away later,” Dorothea
said, not at all understanding Lucy’s complaint.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Deed, missy, ’at’s what Lucy’s for—to put
away youh pretties,” the girl replied, evidently still
more distressed. “Don’t yoh know yoh must never
put youh hat on the baid?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think it will hurt the bed,” Dorothea
laughed back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I ain’t thinking of the baid, Missy,” Lucy explained.
“It’s you, you’self, what’s gwine to have
a big disappointment if you-all puts youh hat on the
baid. Don’t ever forget that, missy, and please
ring for Lucy nex’ time,”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, Lucy,” Dorothea answered mock-seriously.
“Next time I’ll put my hat on the floor
if I don’t ring for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank yoh, missy, I sho’ will be grateful,” answered
Lucy so earnestly that Dorothea looked at
her, surprised at her tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you really believe in luck, Lucy?” Dorothea
asked idly, as the girl was brushing her hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does I believes in luck!” exclaimed Lucy.
She held up her hands in amazement. “Does I believes
in luck? No’m, I don’t believes in it, I knows
it! Didn’t I see the new moon over my right shoulder
and nex’ day didn’t Ole Miss send me for to
take care of yoh?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m not sure that was luck, Lucy,” Dorothea
could not help saying. “At any rate, I can’t see
what the moon had to do with it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The moon’s got a lot to do with luck, baby!”
Lucy insisted. “Yoh kills a hog when the moon’s
dwindlin’ and the meat’s gwine to dwine away to
’mos’ nothin’ when yoh puts it in the pot. Now nobody
won’t say a rabbit’s foot off ’en a rabbit what
was shot runnin’ ’cross a man’s grave of a Friday
in the dark of the moon ain’t boun’ to be lucky.
’Cept ’tis foh that one thing, Friday’s a mighty unlucky
day. You don’t want to start nothin’ on a
Friday, honey.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll try to remember,” said Dorothea, much
amused, but keeping a sober face. “What else
mustn’t I do, Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, missy, thehe’s lots o’ things it ain’t
’zackly good to do,” the girl, launched on a favorite
subject, went on, brushing vigorously the while.
“Yoh mustn’t get out of the wrong side of the baid
in the mornin’. An’ if yoh puts on a stockin’ wrong
side out yoh mus’ wear it awhile befoh yoh change
it—but then, you’he boun’ to change it befoh eleven
o’clock, less ’en yoh wants somethin’ bad to happen.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If that’s all, I’ll try to remember,” Dorothea
answered lightly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Land sakes! Is that all, says you?” Lucy
cried. “No’m, they’s heaps and heaps more, but
I’ll tell ’em to yoh as they comes along. Yoh sho’ly
would forget some of ’em if I told all of ’em to
oncet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her hair finished, Dorothea held out a foot for
a satin slipper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lef’ foot first, missy,” Lucy said pleadingly.
“It’s luckier that a way somehow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So it went on till Dorothea was dressed, but she
was in no hurry to go down till the music told her
the dancing had begun, and seated herself near the
candle. Taking up a book, she accidentally brushed
the paper knife off the table.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That means a gem’man’ comin’ to see yoh,”
Lucy remarked as she picked it up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll not bother over him till he’s here,” Dorothea
replied with a laugh. “You needn’t wait,
Lucy. I’ll not need you again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be on the landin’, missy, to shake out youh
ruffles an’ spread youh ribbons befoh yoh go down
staihs. But they’s somethin’ on my mind, honey,
I wants to ask yoh about.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” Dorothea asked. “You don’t
have to be afraid of me, do you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I isn’t ’zackly afeared,” Lucy explained. “I
knows I ain’t stylish, lak Merry, but I’ve been a
house gal wearin’ shoes fouh years now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She interrupted herself, a new thought striking
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please, missy, what is it mannehs foh Lucy to
call you? Ol’ Miss is Ol’ Miss and Lil’ Miss is
Lil’ Miss, and Miss Harriot is Miss Harry, but foh
a fac’ I don’t know what yoh is, and I been a studyin’
about it a heap.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m Miss Dorothea, I suppose,” Dorothea suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy shook her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s a high bo’n quality name,” she replied
doubtfully, “but they ain’t none of us can say it lak
it should be said. I laid awake half the night
a-practicin’ and a-practicin’, an’ I ain’t got up the
courage yet. It’s too much granjure for my tongue,
I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What would you like to call me?” Dorothea
questioned. “I should like you to call me whatever
you please.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy heaved a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I’ll say Miss Dee, honey,” she announced,
“jes’ lak I’d knowed yoh f’om a baby.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She stopped and Dorothea expected her to go
away, but she still lingered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is there something more, Lucy?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes’m, Miss Dee, there is,” the girl confessed
with marked hesitation, but in a moment it came
out with a rush. “Miss Dee, is you-all some sort
of a Yankee?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, not any kind,” Dorothea answered with a
smile. “My mother was your Old Miss’s sister,
but my father is a Scot and we live in England,
or at least we have always called England our
home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy was evidently disappointed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you can’t tell me what the Yankees is
gwine to do with we-all when we’s free,” she murmured
half to herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea shook her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The North has first to win the war, Lucy,” she
answered. “If they do, you will have to take care
of yourselves and earn your own livings like white
people, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“An’ how’s we-all gwine to do that without any
white-folks learnin’?” demanded the girl.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you could do it by taking care of some one
as you do of me,” Dorothea explained.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy’s eyes widened.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do they pay real money up No’th just for
brushin’ hair and foldin’ up youh pretties?” she
asked excitedly. “An’ could I be free too? But
I guess you must mean Confedrit money, Miss Dee.
You don’t know there’s a sayin’ that a whole bahrel
full of it won’t pay foh the bunghole.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My father pays a maid at home to take care
of me,” Dorothea pointed out, with a laugh. “But
I don’t think she’s any better off than you are.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s what Merry’s always a-sayin’,” Lucy
agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I would be quite satisfied if I were you,” said
Dorothea. “You are as comfortable now as you
are ever likely to be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes’m, that’s what I think—but what’s I gwine
to do if some of ’em meddlin’ Yankees come along
and set me free? That’s what I’m askin’ yoh.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy was still grumbling to herself as she moved
out of the room. Dorothea watched her go, realizing
another of the problems of the South for the
first time, and getting a hint of the state of mind of
the slaves, who had so vague an idea of what their
future was to be.</p>

<p class='c012'>She sat for a moment, but the flapping of the curtain
in front of the window annoyed her and, going
to it, she closed the sash so that the wind might not
blow in. Then she went back to her book by the
table and tried to read.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had scarcely turned a page, however, when
she was startled by three short raps upon the window
pane and, turning toward it, she saw a hand
reaching up from below ready to tap again.</p>

<p class='c012'>For an instant Dorothea’s heart jumped with apprehension,
and then she thought of Lee Hendon
and all fear left her. She ran to the window and,
lifting it again, leaned out. As she expected, the
dark form of a man cowered on the gallery roof
below the window ledge.</p>

<p class='c012'>A pale face looked up at her in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy’s prophecy as a result of the falling knife
had come true. Here indeed was a stranger come
to see her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Water!” came a croaking sound from the figure.
“Water!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea ran back to the stand and poured out a
glassful, carrying it to the window. The up-stretched
hand grasped it, and the man gulped the
contents.</p>

<p class='c012'>“More,” he muttered hoarsely and again she
filled the glass.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you any food?” the man questioned after
he had drunk the second measure.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea shook her head. Then her face brightened.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I have, too,” she whispered. “I’ve some
chocolate. It’s a part of the French soldier’s
rations, so I fancy it won’t hurt you. I’ll get it for
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The man consumed what she gave him ravenously
and showed an immediate improvement in his condition.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Food puts life into a man,” he said. “I’ve had
nothing to eat since yesterday, and only a little
parched corn then. Now, young lady, how am I to
get away from here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Really I don’t know,” Dorothea answered hesitatingly.
“After all, isn’t that your own affair?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They told me I should find some one to help me
at this house,” he answered. “When I saw your
hand as you opened the window just now I knew
where to ask. I’ve been lying here since the hounds
chased me yesterday evening.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you’re not Lee Hendon,” Dorothea whispered
half to herself. “Oh,” she went on a little
louder, “are you escaping from the prison?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” the man answered. “Didn’t you know
that? They told me I could expect help here. You
must be the one. I saw the band on your wrist.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His voice was weak and faint in the darkness as
he crouched against the wall, and it came up to her
only in jerks as if it was difficult for him to speak.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea started, here was prompt confirmation
of Hal’s story. Evidently there was a “Red
String” in the house somewhere, but who could it be?
The place was full almost to overflowing with Confederate
sympathizers, among whom were many
Rebel officers. Yet the man must be saved, even if
she had to do it herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait a moment,” she whispered into the darkness.
“You shall be helped to freedom if it is possible.”</p>

    <div>THE MAN ON THE ROOF</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dorothea was about to leave the window
but she was by no means certain what she
could do, although she was fully determined
to help this poor soldier to his freedom. It was
quite plain that he had expected assistance from
some one in the house; but who could it be, this Red
String in whom she, herself, would now be glad to
confide? She had strongly suspected April when
she had first heard of this mysterious band of Northern
sympathizers, but her cousin’s action which had
led to this conclusion could all be explained by Lee
Hendon’s presence outside the house on the previous
night. Dorothea decided then and there that April
was not a Red String.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene wore a velvet band about her neck,
but Dorothea, like Val Tracy, felt that here was one
above suspicion. Yet there was some one who would
give her the help she needed to save the wretched
man upon the roof if she could but divine who it was.</p>

<p class='c012'>While she still debated the matter in her mind,
his voice came to her out of the darkness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you could get me some food it would be the
best thing that could happen to me,” it said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know how I’m going to do it,” Dorothea
answered. “You see, they are having a ball down
stairs, and probably all the servants are busy, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was halted by the first strains of the music
coming up to them from the parlors below.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you nothing in your room?” the man
asked, weakly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing but the chocolate I gave you—which
you have eaten,” Dorothea answered, and at that
moment there came a knock at the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea closed the window softly and crossed
the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is it?” she asked, controlling her voice as
well as she could.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please, Miss Dee, Ol’ Miss is askin’ where yoh-all
is?” came Lucy’s voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>Instantly Dorothea remembered the bright red
ribbon in the girl’s hair. That there were negroes
in this band of Red Strings was certain, seeing how
necessary their assistance would be if anything secret
was to be done in the South. She was on the
point of taking the maid into her confidence when
a doubt assailed her. Could she be sure of Lucy?
Reluctantly she shook her head. She dared not
make a mistake; the freedom, perhaps the life, of the
man on the roof depended upon her and she could
leave nothing to chance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be down shortly,” she called softly through
the door, “and, Lucy,” she went on, with a sudden
inspiration, “can’t you get me some sandwiches and
a glass of wine? I didn’t eat much supper and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And yoh is faint wif excitement,” Lucy finished
for her. “Yes’m, yoh jes’ stay there and I’ll have
somefin’ up foh yoh in a jiffy,” and Dorothea heard
the girl hurry away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Going back to the window she opened it again and
whispered what she had done.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s the best I can manage at present,” she ended.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It will be a great help,” the man replied. “If
I could just have a bit of sleep and a chance to dress
a wound I received getting out of Andersonville, I
wouldn’t have to bother you further. I’m sorry to
give you so much trouble.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the prospect of food gave the man hope
but, whatever the reason, he spoke in a stronger
voice and in the unmistakable accents of a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c012'>Evidently he was an officer, and Dorothea peered
down in the darkness trying to catch a glimpse of his
features, but it was too dark to see more than a
darker shadow crouched against the wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen,” she elaborated her plans as she talked,
“as soon as my maid comes back I shall put out the
candle and go down stairs. My aunt has sent for
me and if I don’t appear shortly she or my cousins
will come after me. When the light is out you can
slip into the room, and for some hours you will be
safe here. I shall not come back till the dance is
over, which I suppose will be nearly morning. Can
you manage this, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Easily,” came the quiet answer. “You couldn’t
have arranged it better. With a little more strength
I can get on, now that the dogs are off the trail.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell me,” he added, “which of the rooms with
windows opening on this roof belong to men?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The one at the very end,” Dorothea answered.
“That’s Hal May’s room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That will do very well, thank you,” came the
whispered answer. “I shall make that my resting
place so you’ll have no cause to worry about coming
back to your room whenever you want to. I will
take the food, then be off. Thank you a thousand
times.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is there nothing else I can do for you?” Dorothea
asked hurriedly. Somehow she had grown to
have something of a personal interest in this man on
the roof. She hadn’t seen his face, and she was by
no means sympathetic with his cause. But he was
wounded and in danger of going back to Andersonville
Prison, which she had heard Southerners themselves
acknowledge was far from a cheerful place.
She would do what she could to help him escape.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, not a thing,” he answered back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well then,” she went on. “I shall leave
some handkerchiefs on the washstand for your
wound. That’s the best linen I have. You can
come in and warm up by the fire, where I’ll put the
sandwiches and wine. I hope you get—”</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not finish the sentence, for again a knock
came at the door and Lucy’s voice reached her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Miss Dee, please—”</p>

<p class='c012'>She ran across the room and, opening the door a
crack, took the plate and glass out of the astonished
girl’s hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait for me on the stairs,” Dorothea ordered.
“I shall be going down in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She saw Lucy’s eyes widen with surprise, but
there was no time to invent excuses. She knew that
if she did not shortly make an appearance some of
the family would be up looking for her, so she hurried
back to the hearth and placed the plate and wine in
the fire-light. Then, tiptoeing to the window, she
opened it full.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m going,” she whispered; and the next moment
she had blown out the candle and closed the door
behind her with some little noise.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy was not far away and as Dorothea submitted
to the final fluffing of her ruffles she assured
her anxious maid that she was quite well and that
it would not be necessary for Lucy to take the tray
till morning.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t eat everything,” she remarked. “Perhaps
I shall want a sandwich before I go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She did her best to conceal her anxiety for the
man on the roof. If he held to his plan to stay but
a few moments in her room and then make his way
to Hal’s to rest, she felt he had a good chance to
escape undetected; but she would be on pins and
needles for a while. However she did not mean to
show that she was not entirely herself, and sailed
down the stairs and into the parlor with as composed
a face as she could muster. And she made a pretty
picture in her wide Suisse dress and fresh crisp ruffles,
conscious that, although her clothes were not excessively
magnificent they would appear rich in comparison
with the other girls’, who were forced by
the war to wear gowns which had been turned and
remade again and again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lucy, standing with the other servants on the outskirts
of the hall, voiced her pride loudly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ain’t Miss Dee the prettiest an’ the sweetest
little lady heah?” she demanded of Merry beside
her. “I jes lak to set her up on a pedistool and let
yoh-all have a look at her. She’s little foots got a
arch on ’em yoh could let water run under and never
wet the sole. ’Tain’t no field-han’s foot I’m tellin’
yoh, and her waist’s that tenchy I don’t have to pull
her laces while she hol’s her bref. An’ eve’y las’ one
of her clo’s is jes’ kivered wif real lace! That’s
right! I ain’t sayin’ a word but the truf.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fine feathehs make fine birds,” Merry sniffed
scornfully. She was jealous of any one who might
dare to hint at rivaling her young mistress. “Yoh
can talk all yoh’s a-mind to about she’s clo’s, but what
I’s looking at is she’s hair. Jes’ common black,
’tain’t sure enough gold lak Lil’ Miss’!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea slipped into the parlor, to be captured at
once by Mrs. Stewart who was talking to Val Tracy.
The elder woman held out a compelling hand to her,
without stopping the steady flow of her conversation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It may be as you say,” she was complaining in
her usual tone. “I’ll certainly ask Colonel Stewart
to inquire into it, and if you are right perhaps Peru
is the best place for us to go, after all. But it’s
strange I never heard of the Incas if they are as old
a family as the Polks. Probably they are just
nouveaux riches.... Kiss your Aunt Cora, dear,”
she went on to Dorothea with scarcely a break in the
easy flow of her words. “That dress is too sweet
and lovely. I think I’ll have to copy it for Corinne.
She has been complaining that she hasn’t anything fit
to wear, but I tell her, ‘what’s the use if we are going
to Mexico?’ And now it may be Peru and that’s
further still, isn’t it, Val?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe it is,” Tracy remarked, with a twinkling
glance toward Dorothea; “but you might stop at
Mexico on the way and see how you liked it.
Mayn’t I have this dance, Miss Drummond?” he
ended, turning to the girl whose feet were already in
motion to the gallop the negro musicians from the
quarter had struck up.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea nodded and in a moment they were off
together.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think you like to dance,” Tracy murmured
after they had gone half round the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do like it,” Dorothea answered; “but I haven’t
had much practice, and perhaps I don’t do it very
well. You see at home, in England, they think I’m
too young to go to dances yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re a very fairy on your toes,” Val assured
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea laughed joyously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should like to believe so,” she answered, “but
I’m afraid I can’t take your word for it, can I?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Miss Drummond,” Val replied with mock
despair. “Could you doubt me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can hardly be expected to have much faith in
what you say after what I heard you telling Mrs.
Stewart about the Incas of Peru,” Dorothea replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith, I but told her the truth,” he grinned.
“They are the oldest family I know of in this
hemisphere; and as for your dancing, save one dance
I have with Miss Imogene, I’ll be pleased to dance
with you all night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That would hardly please Miss Imogene,” Dorothea
replied, shaking her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aye, and there’s something in that,” Tracy
agreed. “Is she not a wonder now? On the other
side she’d be wearin’ a cap and spectacles and sittin’
by the chimney corner knittin’. But here—faith,
she’s the light of every party! Were I a little
younger I’d be askin’ her to marry me, this night;
but seein’ I’m all of twenty-three I’ve grave fears
I’d age too fast for her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Val Tracy with his raillery kept Dorothea’s mind
off the man upstairs for the time being, but when
the music stopped her thoughts flew back to him with
a sudden thump at her heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He must have gone to Hal’s room by this time,”
she said to herself, not knowing whether to be glad
or more anxious on that account. A moment later
she was claimed by another partner and for a while
was so busy trying to remember the names of all the
new people to whom she was introduced that she
had little time for anything else.</p>

<p class='c012'>April, more radiant and beautiful than ever, had
an eye upon her cousin and saw to it that she did
not lack partners.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope you are having a good time, Dorothea,”
she said, upon one occasion, with one of her most
beaming smiles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea thanked her and smiled back, with an
open admiration that she could not have concealed
if she had been so minded. April needed no imported
finery to set off her charms and no one at the
party had any doubt about who was the belle of it.
But as she watched her dancing with the Confederate
officers and heard her leading all the most patriotic
songs of the South; when she saw her cousin’s eyes
kindle with enthusiasm at the mention of the Cause
for which a rebel army was fighting, it was impossible
to believe April a member of this band of Red
Strings of which she had become so intimately aware.
The thought that it was Lee Hendon who was the
mainspring of her actions grew to a conviction.</p>

<p class='c012'>Time for such reflections came to Dorothea only
now and then. She was never left to herself, but
Val Tracy came for another dance which she was
ready enough to give. She liked the young Irishman
as did every one, apparently, and it occurred to her
that he might help her solve some of the puzzling
questions that had begun to throw a shadow of doubt
upon her loyalty to the Southern cause.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell me, Mr. Tracy,” she asked quietly, “do
they always set bloodhounds on escaping prisoners
down here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked at her a moment quizzically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You didn’t like it, eh?” he said finally. “Well,
to tell you the truth, Miss Drummond, I’m not what
you’d call keen about it meself. Faith, this catchin’
man with dogs—!” He shook his head vigorously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s very cruel,” Dorothea murmured, half to
herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, but, Miss Drummond,” Tracy answered,
“you must remember that they have been doing it in
this country for years and years and they don’t see
any harm in it. You must take things as you find
them, I suppose; though I confess this huntin’ men
with hounds goes against the grain with me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will they catch him, do you think?” she questioned,
more anxiously than he could possibly know.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There aren’t many escape safely from Andersonville,”
he answered. “Some of them do get out;
but they’re brought back sooner or later, poor creatures.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why do you have such prisons?” Dorothea demanded
almost angrily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, Miss Drummond,” he returned quickly,
“don’t blame me for these prisons. They’re none of
mine. I’m only a small cog in a very big wheel; but
to tell the truth the problem isn’t as easy a one to
solve as you’d think. We can’t give our own men
enough food and clothes, so you’d hardly expect the
prisoners to fare better.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea was about to reply when Hal May came
hurriedly across the dancing floor and stopped beside
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Val,” he said, under his breath, “you’ll have to
excuse yourself to Dorothea. You’ll let him go,
won’t you?” he went on directly to the girl.
“Fielding, who was out last night after that escaped
officer, is back again and wants to see us. I told
him we’d talk to him in my bed chamber, upstairs.
It was the only private spot I could think of. Take
Dorothea to mother, and join us as quickly as you
can.” Hal went away hurriedly and Tracy started
across the room toward where Mrs. May was sitting
with some of the elder ladies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea walked beside him mechanically. The
man upstairs was lost. They would come upon him,
sleeping in Hal’s room, and the poor fellow would
have to go back to the prison horrors from which
he had tried, so desperately, to escape. And there
was nothing she could do. Already, she supposed,
Hal and the man Fielding were upstairs. She
shrank from contact with these chattering people.
She wanted to be alone, to think of some way of
escape for the poor man if she could.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t wish to go to Aunt ’Thenia for a moment,”
she whispered, when they were half way
across the room. “I would rather go out on the gallery
for a breath of air.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked at her sharply, and noted that her face
had suddenly grown pale.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aren’t you feeling well?” he asked with a touch
of anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>For an instant it occurred to her that by saying
“yes” she could keep him at her side. Then she
realized the uselessness of this. Tracy was only
one. No doubt Hal had summoned other officers
to the conference and probably the man was already
taken.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s the heat I’m unused to; I shall be all right
in a moment,” she answered, and with that he left
her and she took her way unnoticed out on to the
broad porch.</p>

    <div>A FRIEND IN NEED</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dorothea had no definite plan in her mind
when she went out on the long dark gallery.
Her only desire was to be alone for a while
to try to think of some way to aid the poor prisoner
upstairs. But it required no reflection to show her
that she was quite powerless. The case, as she saw
it, was hopeless. The man was, in all probability a
prisoner already and would be justified in thinking
that she herself had taken a hand in his recapture.</p>

<p class='c012'>She could see only one possibility of his escaping.
If he was wakened in time he might be able to get out
on the roof again and continue in hiding. She halted
suddenly, an impulse coming to her to run upstairs
and try to warn him, but she shook her head. Common
sense told her it was too late to do anything.</p>

<p class='c012'>She turned a corner of the house and looked out
upon the lawn. There, dim shadows in the darkness,
she could see the forms of several horses, and walking
slowly up and down, with his gaze fixed upon
the piazza roof, was a soldierly figure, intently
watching. She stopped, half hidden by the turn in
the house, and waited.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a moment or two she heard a window raised
in one of the rooms above.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you down there, Mason?” It was Hal’s
voice, pitched low.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir,” came the answer from the man pacing
slowly across the lawn.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Keep your eye open,” Hal called down. “I’m
going to take a look along the roof here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea heard her cousin clamber out of the
window and, a moment later, the creaking of the
tin as he tiptoed over her head. She held her hand
to her heart, tense with excitement, and dreading the
outcome. From this move on Hal’s part she argued
that the Confederate officers had not yet found their
man. Perhaps he had gotten away, after all.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her rising hope that this was true was confirmed
by her cousin who called softly that there was no
one on the roof. The girl’s spirits rose with a
bound. The man was gone and she was more glad
than she would have thought possible. He was an
enemy of those with whom her sympathy lay. She
still believed in the cause the South was fighting for.
Yet for all that she could not help rejoicing that this
man had escaped; indeed she felt like dancing. The
music in the parlors called her and she turned to go
back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s because they send hounds after them,” she
thought to herself, trying to explain her perplexing
state of mind. She would have denied with perfect
sincerity that she wished the North to win the war,
but she could not hide from herself the fact that she
had seen things that had dulled the keen edge of her
enthusiasm for the Confederate Cause.</p>

<p class='c012'>As she was about to step through the doorway
into the house she ran sharply into April coming out
hurriedly. Both girls drew back and for an instant
eyed each other in silence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am sorry if you are not having a good time,”
April said at length, with a touch of asperity in her
tone. “I missed you and was wondering where
you were.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but I was enjoying myself,” Dorothea strove
to put enthusiasm in her words. “I just came out
for a little air.”</p>

<p class='c012'>April turned to go back into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You seem fond of the porch in the evenings,”
she remarked over her shoulder, but there was no
accompanying smile and Dorothea felt that a barrier
of some sort had sprung up between them. For all
that she was not convinced that her cousin’s errand
was to seek her. She wondered at once if April
knew what was going on upstairs. Perhaps, after
all, this beautiful cousin had had a hand in the
prisoner’s escape and was coming out to see if all
were well. She could not be sure and again felt herself
to be in the midst of affairs which she could not
explain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, as she was about to make her way into the
parlors her heart gave a great thump with a realization
of the possibility that the Union soldier might
still be in her room. In that case he must be warned
before a search of the whole house was made.</p>

<p class='c012'>With this in mind she hurried up the stairs, crossed
the hall, and closed her door softly behind her. She
heard the murmur of men’s voices coming from Hal’s
quarters, but knew no one had seen her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Inside, the window was open, a dull fire still burned
in the hearth, but she noted that the sandwiches and
wine remained as she had left them, untouched. Evidently,
she thought, the man had not had time to eat
before he was forced to leave. She crossed the
room, intending to shut the window but, ere she
reached it, her eyes fell upon a dark heap on the
floor beside her bed. She halted, looking down with
a sudden fear in her heart and then breathed a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He took a disguise and left his clothes here,”
she half murmured to herself. But, when she
stooped down to examine the meager bundle more
closely, she saw that there was a man still in the
shabby uniform, a man so thin and wasted as to be
little more than a skeleton.</p>

<p class='c012'>She thought at first that he was dead, but, snatching
her hand-glass, she held it in front of his parched
lips and found it clouded. The man was alive, how
long he could remain so she dared not think. In the
half light from the fire, to her inexperienced eyes, he
looked as if each succeeding minute might easily be
his last.</p>

<p class='c012'>But what was she to do now? Whom could she
trust? Certainly none of the servants, who would
probably scream in terror and alarm the entire household
at the first sight of the poor, huddled body.
Her mind was busy with this problem, but instinctively
she had taken the glass of wine and was trying
to force a little of it through the pale lips, when
there came a knock at her door.</p>

<p class='c012'>Instantly she was on her feet, her nerves taut; but
by no means ready to give up without a fight. So
far her part had been passive, now that the man
could no longer help himself she meant to try her
utmost to save him. That it was Hal or Val Tracy
coming on a search of the house, she had no doubt.
However they would not enter so long as she was
there, and she vowed to herself that she would remain
in the room till Doomsday rather than let either
of them in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is it?” she asked, and expected to hear the
deep voice of one of the men, but greatly to her
consternation the door was opened and in walked
Miss Imogene.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is I, honey,” said the dainty little lady, closing
the door behind her and advancing into the room.
“What are you doing here in the dark?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I just came up for a moment,” Dorothea replied,
without a tremor in her voice. Here was a more
dangerous situation even than she had anticipated
and her wits were working fast to meet it. “I will
go down with you at once.” She made a motion as if
to start for the door, hoping that Miss Ivory would
take the hint and go out too; but the latter evidently
had no such intention for she stood before the fireplace,
placing a dainty foot upon the fender to warm
it before the fitful blaze.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do put another log on the fire, child,” she requested.
“My toes are icy and—my dear, I want
a little chat with you. I don’t think you can be enjoying
your party—hiding alone up here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but really I have been—indeed I have
been,” Dorothea protested. “I just came up—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“For the same reason you went out on the porch,”
Miss Imogene interrupted, with a swift upward
glance. “Come, child, put on a fresh log and let
your old cousin have five minutes with you. The
evening is not half over.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a new tone in the pretty voice that surprised
Dorothea. She had thought of Miss Imogene
as a sweet and gentle spinster who spent most of her
life in social gayety or in doing some pleasant task
out of the hurry and bustle of the world. Now she
felt that under the sweet manner there was a will
that might prove stubborn if the cause arose. Moreover
there was nothing to do but comply with the
request unless she chose to be deliberately rude.
That she could not be, even though she could find no
excuse ready to her tongue.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea placed a fresh log on the fire and then
stood beside her visitor, the two looking down in
silence as the wood caught and flamed up in a cheerful blaze.
Then, quite suddenly, so that Dorothea
was surprised, Miss Imogene turned and glanced
about the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea’s heart sank. She saw no possibility of
the shrunken figure on the floor escaping Miss
Imogene’s sharp eyes. Nor was she mistaken.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s quite a pretty room by fire-light,” said the
little lady and took a step toward the bed. A moment
later she was beside the prostrate man, looking
down at him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s this, child?” she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea hurried to her side.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Cousin Imogene, it is a Union officer escaped
from Andersonville,” Dorothea whispered. “They
are hunting for him now. They think he’s here,
and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why didn’t you tell one of the men, Hal or Val
Tracy?” demanded the elder woman with a trace
of severity in her tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because I wouldn’t give him up,” Dorothea
maintained stoutly. “I’m not a real Rebel. I’m
British; and though I do believe the South is right
I don’t think they should hunt men with dogs. And,
Cousin Imogene, I mean to do all I can to help him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know who he is?” was the next question.
Dorothea’s plea did not seem to have made
any impression on the little lady, who suddenly had
grown rather imperious and whose gentleness had
dropped from her like a cloak.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, of course not,” Dorothea answered, surprised.
“But he’s a Federal officer and he’s been
on the porch roof all night without anything to eat
and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Light a candle and bring it here,” her cousin
commanded, dropping to her knees as Dorothea
obeyed.</p>

<p class='c012'>With a deft hand Miss Imogene turned the face
of the shrunken figure to the light. As she looked at
it she gave a smothered cry.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s Larry Stanchfield!” she exclaimed and at
the name the man opened his eyes and looked up at
the two leaning over him.</p>

<p class='c012'>For an instant there was silence, and then Miss
Imogene spoke in a strained voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll help you, Dorothea,” she said. “Go lock
the door.”</p>

    <div>MISS IMOGENE TAKES CHARGE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When Dorothea hurried back after locking
the door she found that Miss Imogene
was holding up the young man’s head and
had managed to force some of the wine down his
throat. A minute later a little color came into his
cheek and he smiled up at them in a weak, embarrassed
way.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sorry,” he murmured; “I’m an utter idiot to
do this—but how did you know I was Larry Stanchfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I knew your father when he was about your age,”
Miss Imogene replied gently. “For the moment
I was silly enough to take you for him. But we
haven’t time to talk of that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Young Stanchfield struggled to sit up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is really unpardonable,” he stammered.
“I should not be here at all. I’ll go at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll go as far as the fire,” Miss Imogene
pointed out in a tone that admitted of no argument.
“For the present you are safe here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I never intended to stay in this room,” he
protested, “and it isn’t of my own safety I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is what I am thinking of,” Miss Imogene replied.
“Although we must get rid of you, or we
shall be suspected of not being the staunch Rebels we
are. Come over by the fire now and warm yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene spoke lightly, but there was a
serious undertone in her voice and the young man,
looking first at her and then at Dorothea, nodded
his head as if he understood more than her words
implied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are very good,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c012'>But he had noted the band of red velvet about
Miss Imogene’s throat and Dorothea had caught the
expression of comprehension that had passed over
his face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He, thinks Cousin Imogene’s a Red String, too,”
she thought, and then, “How do I know that she
isn’t?”</p>

<p class='c012'>With an effort Stanchfield rose and staggered toward
the fireplace; but when Miss Ivory would have
steadied him with a hand on his arm he winced.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not that arm,” he muttered; “it’s—it’s
scratched a bit.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sorry,” Miss Imogene said; “I shall have a
look at it presently, but first of all we must get you
some strengthening food.” They seated him in
front of the fire, and he leaned back with a sigh of
relief; but he seemed so weak that Miss Imogene
looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is a flask in my room and glass of milk,”
Miss Imogene spoke half to herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, pray don’t trouble,” Stanchfield faltered;
and then, before their eyes, he fainted straight away.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the silence that followed they could hear the
low-toned murmur of men’s voices and, suddenly,
the sound of a closing door far down the hall. Miss
Imogene and Dorothea looked at each other apprehensively,
for a moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lock it, after me, child,” Miss Imogene whispered,
starting toward the door with an air of determination,
“and don’t let any one in till I come back.
I’ll only be a minute.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She left the room swiftly, after a glance up and
down the hall, and Dorothea turned the key and
waited.</p>

<p class='c012'>A little later there came a knock and, expecting
Miss Imogene’s return, she opened noiselessly. Before
her stood Val Tracy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you’re in here,” he said, with some embarrassment;
“I didn’t know. You see we’re looking
for that escaped man. We haven’t found him yet
and we’re searching the house. Of course, as you’re
here, we can take for granted a Union officer isn’t in
this room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His eyes wandered over the girl’s head for a moment
and then, with a bow, he drew back into the
semi-darkness of the hall. Dorothea, without a
word closed the door, her breath coming in short,
quick gasps. It was so narrow an escape that she
had all the sensations of having been caught. A
few minutes later Miss Imogene came back with
milk and brandy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea in a few quick words told of Tracy’s
visit and Miss Imogene shook her head doubtfully
at the girl’s assurance that he had seen nothing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope not,” she replied, “but we can’t speculate
about that. We must bring this boy around as
quickly as we can.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She forced some of the brandy between Stanchfield’s
lips and presently he came to himself. A stiff
punch and the sandwiches seemed to restore his
strength like magic, and Miss Imogene turned her
attention to his injured arm.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, please don’t bother with it,” Stanchfield insisted.
“I can fix it myself now. That’s what I
was trying to do when I fainted like the silly idiot
that I am. An old darky dressed it for me the second
day I was out of Andersonville. It’s nothing
but a flesh wound, and it was doing pretty well, considering,
till I climbed up the vines to the porch roof
to get away from the hounds. Then it opened again,
and I’m afraid it’s rather a mess. But please don’t
bother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorothea, hold the candle over here,” Miss
Imogene said calmly, utterly ignoring this plea.
“I’ll slit the sleeve. We’ll have to get you other
clothes from somewhere, anyhow. Did that hurt?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her delicate fingers that seemed not to be made
for such things, deftly separated the stained shirt
from the clotted blood, and Dorothea, unused to such
sights, felt herself growing sick and faint at this
wound which the young man had called a scratch.
But she summoned her courage and, although she
was rather white about the lips, managed to give
Miss Imogene all the help that lady needed, so that
very shortly the washing and bandaging was over.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I feel like a new man,” Stanchfield declared in
a little while. “Now I must go. I can’t be here at
daybreak.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He started to his feet, but was still so weak that
in spite of his determination he fell back into his
chair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The truth is,” Miss Imogene remarked with a
wrinkled brow, “you must have rest to recuperate.
But what to do with you, my boy, I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In a little I shall be myself again,” Stanchfield
insisted. “At the worst I can get back on the roof
and wait till my strength returns. Whatever happens
I cannot involve you ladies in my troubles.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear boy,” Miss Imogene spoke softly, “I
knew your father so well that anything I might do
for you would but repay in a slight measure much
that I owe him. There must be some way found to
start you out again with a chance of escape.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She spoke so earnestly that it would have seemed
rudeness to protest further. Stanchfield bowed his
head as if in assent to her assumption of the responsibility.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is your father still alive?” Miss Imogene asked
after a moment’s silence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He was, the last time I heard of him,” Stanchfield
answered. “He is a Major in our army now,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t know,” Miss Imogene said, looking
down into the fire with a return of her old manner.
“I didn’t know. I haven’t heard of him for many
years, but some day I might meet him. Could I
face him, knowing that I might have helped his son
and did not try? No, no. For the sake of a dear
friendship I am doubly bound.” She paused and
then, lifting her head with a determined air, spoke
directly to Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“May I share your room to-night, honey?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” answered Dorothea readily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then Lieutenant Stanchfield shall have one good
night’s rest at least,” Miss Imogene spoke determinedly;
but she was interrupted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear lady,” Stanchfield broke in, seeing the
drift of her words. “It is impossible. You have
no idea what the conditions are in Andersonville.
I am not fit to inhabit a decent place.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will see to that,” Miss Imogene replied with a
smile. “There’s a huge brass pitcher filled with
water in the fireplace and a tub under the bed. Hot
water and China-berry soap is what I prescribe.
You will have strength enough to manage that.
After, you will sleep the better and in the meantime
I’ll find some other clothes for you somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must stick to the rags of my uniform,” Stanchfield
said. “So long as I wear that, I am at least
not in danger of my life as a spy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then tie it in a towel and place it outside your
door,” Miss Imogene instructed him. “I’ll have
my maid clean it. I think I can trust her. At least
I can scare her, for I have done it before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are the most thoughtful person in the
world,” Stanchfield murmured gratefully. “I’d
rather have clean clothes than food, even!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You shall have both,” Miss Imogene promised.
“And you need not fear interruption. Even my
maid is instructed not to enter my room without
leave. I am sure you will be safe there. There is
a large screen in the room and a huge wardrobe. If
worst comes to worst you can hide.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As she finished speaking they all became aware of
the murmur of voices on the lawn below. Quick as
a flash Miss Imogene blew out the candle and hurried
to the window. A moment later there came a low-toned
exchange of farewells and the soft thuds of
horses moving away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are gone without their prisoner,” Miss
Imogene whispered as she came back to the fire.
“All is safe now. The music down stairs will drown
the noise of anything we do up here. But we have
no more time to waste, for we shall both be missed
if we do not return to the dance. Dorothea, go into
my room and light the candle. We will wait till you
come back to tell us if all is clear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea went off and found time to pull out the
tub from under the bed and place it before the fire.
She feared that Mr. Stanchfield might not be able
to do that for himself. Also she found two eggs,
one of which she brought back with her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah,” exclaimed the little lady, as she saw the
egg in Dorothea’s hand. “That is my morning
dose and the very thing you will need this evening,
Mr. Stanchfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She mixed the egg with a little milk and brandy
and made the young man swallow it, after which he
declared himself ready for anything. But even yet
he was very, very weak and both Miss Imogene and
Dorothea hovered about him as he tottered along
the hall. However he reached his goal safely and
within the doorway he turned and, seizing a hand of
each of his rescuers, pressed them to his lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It will be like Heaven here,” he said brokenly,
then he closed the door softly behind him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor lad,” whispered Miss Imogene. Then
gently, “To think I should meet his son here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So far there had not been the slightest hitch in
their plans. The music below was loud and they
thought that no one had seen them, but as they turned
to take their way below they heard the door of Val
Tracy’s room softly close.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

    <div>UNCERTAINTY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Instead of going down stairs directly, both
Miss Imogene and Dorothea turned into the latter’s
room and looked at each other in consternation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you suppose Lieutenant Tracy saw us?”
Dorothea asked, under her breath.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m afraid he did, honey,” Miss Imogene said,
shaking her head disconsolately so that her curls
quivered delicately. “Poor Larry! He’ll have to
go back to that place of torture, and he won’t last
long from the looks of him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But we must do something,” Dorothea insisted
vehemently. “There must be something we can do.
We must think. Why didn’t Mr. Tracy take him at
once instead of going back to his own room? Perhaps
he’s giving us a chance to get the poor fellow
away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene shook her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, he wouldn’t do that, my dear,” she answered.
“But he knows that a man who can’t cross
the hall without the help of two females to keep him
from falling, isn’t going to run far.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then let us warn Mr. Stanchfield and he can go
out on the roof again and hide,” Dorothea suggested.
“It’s been searched, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They would find him,” Miss Imogene said.
“No, there is only one thing we can do. I’m going
to appeal to Val himself to parole the lad in my care
until he is stronger. I’ll promise to turn him over
some time. That’s our best chance now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She did not wait to consider the matter further but
ran into the hall and knocked at Tracy’s door.
Dorothea, watching, saw her stand a moment listening,
then knock again and, receiving no response,
open the door and look into the room. Then she
hurried back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s not there, honey,” she whispered. “In
that second we were talking he must have gone to
lay an information.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps Lieutenant Tracy wasn’t there at all,”
Dorothea whispered, hopefully. “It might have
been a breath of air that closed the door, mightn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s possible,” Miss Imogene agreed, and
paused a moment in deep thought. “At any rate,
honey, we must act as if no one knew what we had
been doing. I shall make it my business to find out
if Val does know. Come, we must go down now.
I’ve no doubt we’ve been missed already, so I shall
say we’ve been having a little talk together. Don’t
lose your courage, dear. After all we’re not sure
Val saw us. Come!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She led the way down stairs, her smile as gay and
unconcerned as ever, and Dorothea tried her best
to imitate her care-free manner. At the foot of the
stairs they met April, who stopped short in her tracks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was wondering where you were,” April announced,
looking squarely at Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Dorothea has been taking pity upon her old
cousin,” Miss Imogene cut in. “We have been
warming ourselves by the fire in her room. Old
ladies do not have as many partners as they are used
to and sometimes they like to slip away and forget
that they are no longer belles. Dorothea has tried
to make me forget.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the first time I ever heard that you lacked
partners, Cousin Imogene,” April replied, not at all
convinced by this explanation, but at that moment a
young officer came up to claim a dance and there was
no further opportunity to discuss the matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Be careful of April,” Miss Imogene whispered
in Dorothea’s ear. “Her eyes are very sharp. Remember
she would stop at nothing to aid the Confederacy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Before Dorothea could more than nod, each had
been claimed by partners and they were separated
for the time being. Dorothea danced with Hal, who
informed her that he was convinced that there never
had been an escaped prisoner about the place and
that it was foolish to put such absolute reliance in
the hounds as some people were disposed to do.
Under other circumstances this might have been
cheering news to the girl, but she had no faith in her
own theory of a draught and believed that Tracy
was aware of what had been going on and, although
she felt that the fact of Hal’s not being informed as
yet might give some little encouragement, she was
certain that sooner or later the whole household
would know of the effort she had made to aid Larry
Stanchfield to escape from Andersonville.</p>

<p class='c012'>An hour or so later she was sitting between dances
talking to a young man whom she had met that evening,
when, looking across the room, she saw Val
Tracy walk over and take a seat beside Miss Imogene.
For some time Dorothea lost all idea of what
her polite attendant was saying and he, doing his best
to entertain this attractive young lady, grew more
and more convinced that girls from England were
cold and unresponsive, if not stupid.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene, with a bright untroubled smile,
looked up at Val as he joined her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you coming to take pity upon a poor wall
flower?” she asked in her gentlest and most appealing
manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am most lucky to find you alone,” he answered
gallantly. “It is unheard of for so lovely a
lady not to be surrounded by a bevy of partners.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sit down and stop blarneying,” she ordered,
patting a chair beside her. “I have been wondering
where you were, and after all your vows of constancy
how can I be expected to enjoy myself when
you desert me?” She laughed lightly. These two
always amused themselves, and others, with their
extravagant expressions of devotion. “Where have
you been?” she added.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Searching after mysteries,” he answered, with
a bantering air. “I begin to think there are Red
Strings about.” He laughed as he spoke and looked
away across the room to where Dorothea sat, while
Miss Imogene said to herself that he <i>did</i> know what
was afoot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you believe in that silly tale?” she questioned.
“I, for one, think it is just one of those
stories that people make up for excitement’s sake.
You might think I was a Red String because I wear
a red velvet band about my neck.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps I do,” he answered promptly, turning
to her with a quick glance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene threw back her head and gave a
gay laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are so funny, Val,” she chuckled. “Why
not suspect April because she had a red belt on the
other day? Or little Miss Dorothea across the way
there, or the fiddler with his red necktie? If it is
cause for suspicion to wear red, ah, then every
brunette in the South will be suspected. And, my
dear boy, they won’t give up their most becoming
color because of this tale of Red Strings.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith ’tis the red in their cheeks that makes fools
of us men,” Tracy answered half seriously, his eyes
again wandering across the room. “But what’s the
good of thinking of fair maids these days? There’s
a Yankee bullet waiting for me now, for all I know.
Molded and ready and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tut, tut, such a way for a brave soldier to talk,”
Miss Imogene interrupted. “Would you have me
crying before all these people?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There will be few tears for me when I catch that
bullet,” Tracy replied; but he laughed, and the momentary
seriousness, so unusual with him, disappeared.
“Faith, Miss Imogene, there’s a deal of
nonsense in all this talk of brave soldiers. I was
quaking in my shoes not ten minutes ago, fearing I
might cross an enemy and him ready to fight for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where have you been to look for enemies?”
Miss Imogene demanded with a fine show of surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you not know?” he asked, with lifted brow.
“There’s been a great hue and cry after an escaped
prisoner. The same fellow they were hunting for
last night. It seems they haven’t caught him and
were persuaded he was still here. As if he’d ever
been here at all! And I losing half a dozen dances
by their silliness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He <i>didn’t</i> see!” Miss Imogene thought, with a
great sense of relief, and then aloud, “Is that where
all the men have been?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is,” he answered. “We’ve been through the
house. They left it to me to search your room. I
haven’t done it—yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He hesitated just an instant on the last word and
again her anxiety came back to Miss Imogene. “He
does know after all and is warning me,” she told
herself but still could not be certain. When he had
first come over to her she had been determined to tell
him all, and beg that Larry Stanchfield might remain
under her care till he had recovered. Now
she racked her brains to know what course was
wisest, and then, suddenly, her mind was made up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Seriously, Val,” she began, “suppose a fair
female suddenly came upon a poor fellow in the
midst of his enemies and, when she saw him, she
found that it was a matter of the affections with her.
That instead of a stranger there was the image of
her lover. What would you have her do, Val?”
She ended with her voice dropped almost to a whisper
and looking him full in the face.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tracy did not reply at once but sat gazing across
the room with unseeing eyes. Then suddenly he
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, faith! the best thing to do in a case of that
kind, Miss Imogene, is to tell a soft-hearted Irishman.”
He laughed and bowed to her. “I think I
can get the next dance with Miss Drummond. Sure,
I’ll try. It may be the last chance I’ll ever have.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His departure left her puzzled, and she watched
him cross the floor to where Dorothea was sitting.
Presently the girl’s partner departed, glad to escape
so stupid a female, whose only conversation was a
vague “yes,” or “no,” which did not come always
in the right place.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If the child but keeps up her courage,” Miss
Imogene thought, as she watched the scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea, meanwhile, was smiling up at Tracy,
though she felt all anxiety. She would have given
all she had to know the conversation that had taken
place between the young officer and Miss Imogene.
But she could not even guess at it, so resolved to be on
her guard and talk as if what had occurred in the interval
since last she saw him, had never happened.
This he made easy by referring to their previous
conversation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I come with good news for you, Miss Drummond,”
he began. “They haven’t found the escaped
prisoner after all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I confess I’m glad,” Dorothea said frankly.
“Of course that’s not the thing to say here in the
South, but I just can’t help being pleased to think any
one has gotten away from Andersonville. Hal said
it was silly to look for him about here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It seems to have been,” Tracy answered, and the
music striking up, he asked her for the dance.</p>

<p class='c012'>They whirled away together, not speaking for
some moments, and then Val broke in upon her anxious
thoughts with a question.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Suppose, Miss Drummond,” he said, “that a
chap found himself growing fond of a certain girl
and discovered suddenly that his rival was on the
scene, though he nor any one else had had any notion
of it. What should he do about it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>For a moment Dorothea was puzzled. She
thought, when he began to speak, that he was making
a reference to Stanchfield, but this talk of a rival and
a love affair made that impossible. Evidently
Tracy was in love with April and had discovered
that Hendon was near. He suspected, as she did,
that April knew this, and was asking her what he
should do.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How can I answer that, Mr. Tracy?” she replied.
“Perhaps there isn’t a rival after all. Perhaps
it’s only gossip. At any rate that chap you just
spoke of needn’t give up—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t you think he need?” he interrupted eagerly.
“He might do a good deal if he thought there
was a chance for him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He might do anything that was honorable,” she
answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And, faith, how can we measure honor?” Val
cut in with a touch of bitterness in his voice. “That
chap, you know, might have two honors to satisfy.
One for the girl he loved and one for the country
he served.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Again Dorothea wondered if it was Stanchfield he
had in mind, but dismissed this thought at once.
There could be no question of rivalry, as far as the
young man upstairs was concerned. He knew no
one in the house except Miss Imogene and herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Before she had decided how to answer the dance
ended and supper was announced.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What can I get for you?” Tracy asked, as she
seated herself in the hall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing, thank you,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but you must have something,” he insisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea shook her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I feel as if refreshments would choke me when
I think of the poor prisoners at Andersonville,” she
replied. “I haven’t any appetite for such luxuries.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Tracy shrugged his broad shoulders and then sat
down beside her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t you think you exaggerate a bit, Miss
Drummond?” he began. “These luxuries, as you
call them, are not so rich as they sound. The cake is
made of bolted corn meal and sorghum. The sherbet
is sweetened with honey, the coffee is made from
thin slices of potato browned in the oven and ground
up. That doesn’t sound very expensive, does it?
And yet that is the best we can do in the way of
luxuries. Indeed some of our parties are ‘starvation
parties,’ with no refreshments at all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But every one is so gay and seems so happy and
regardless of all this misery going on near them.”
Dorothea was not quite herself, and Tracy looked
at her questioningly before he answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is strange to you, I suppose,” he went on.
“But you must remember that the Southern ladies
pretend that they are as well off as ever. No matter
what comes they mean to meet it with smiling faces.
That needs courage; and remember, too, they are
fighting for their freedom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what of freedom for the slaves?” Dorothea
demanded sharply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hush,” Tracy replied gravely. “For your own
sake you must guard your words. An Abolitionist
could not be tolerated here. And remember your
aunt must be considered, for you are staying in her
house and she is responsible for what you do and
say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re right,” Dorothea answered; “and it isn’t
that I don’t think the South is justified in fighting.
I’ve always thought that. That is what every one
believes in England, but since I have been here there
are so many things I can’t understand. You won’t
tell on me, will you?” she ended with a smile at him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m not a dyed in the wool Rebel myself,” he
answered with the same lightness of manner. “I’m
an adopted son of the South.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How did you come to be in it at all?” Dorothea
questioned. She liked this young Irishman, and in
his company was forgetting for the moment that
there were matters that should be causing her plenty
of anxiety.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I’m in it because I’m Irish, I suppose, and
love a good fight,” he answered. “I was living in
Charleston when the war broke out, and there one
heard but this side of the quarrel. I’ve seen a thing
or two since, but I’m not denying that I would do the
same again. And I’ll do my duty, you may be sure
of that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His last words were uttered with a note of seriousness
and Dorothea remembered with a pang that perhaps
already he had prepared to send Stanchfield
back to Andersonville.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope you will always make sure where your
duty lies,” she said half to herself, but he caught
the words and nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have made up my mind as to that,” he answered,
and the next dance beginning, they were
separated.</p>

<p class='c012'>A half hour later Dorothea and Miss Imogene
were back in the girl’s room for the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What did Val Tracy say to you, child?” Miss
Imogene demanded in an undertone, when they were
at last alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing whatever to do with Mr. Stanchfield,”
Dorothea answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you sure?” Miss Imogene asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite sure, Cousin Imogene,” Dorothea answered.
“Did he say anything to you? Does he
know?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t tell, and that’s the truth,” Miss Imogene
replied slowly. “We can only wait. Sometimes I
think he knows and then I—I don’t know what I
think; but I shall be up at daylight to see what has
happened.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea blew out the candle a little later and
crept into bed beside Miss Imogene.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish it was one of the others who was going
to betray us,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why do you wish that?” demanded Miss
Imogene.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because I like him,” Dorothea confessed frankly.
“But of course he’s in love with April. He told me
as much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is what I’ve always thought,” Miss
Imogene agreed, and then there was silence. But
only one of them really slept soundly that night.</p>

    <div>AN UNEXPECTED DISAPPEARANCE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dorothea had not expected to sleep a wink
but she suddenly found herself awake with
the sun streaming in at the window. She
had a feeling that it was still early, but in a little she
heard sounds coming from the direction of the cookhouse
and there was a faint smell of fried bacon in
the air, so that she knew it was not any too early to
start Larry Stanchfield on his way, and she turned
over to speak to Miss Imogene, a little fearful lest
they had overslept.</p>

<p class='c012'>To her surprise Miss Imogene’s place was empty
and the girl looked about the room a little bewildered,
and still somewhat sleepy. Then she jumped out of
bed and put on a dressing-wrapper to be ready for
anything that might happen.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had not long to wait. In a few minutes Miss
Imogene came noiselessly into the room with a face
of anxious perplexity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” whispered Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know, child,” was the answer. “He’s
gone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Stanchfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then it’s all right,” murmured Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish I knew, but I’m afraid not,” Miss
Imogene went on. “I couldn’t sleep in that soft
nightgown of yours after Macon Mills muslin, so,
when you were sound asleep, I slipped out. I
wanted to see if there was any chance of his getting
off before the others woke; but, my dear, there was
Val Tracy’s whole troop camped around the house!
I could see their camp fires. That made me despair,
for I wanted to get that bundle of clothes out of the
way at least. But the boy didn’t put them outside
his door. This was in the night, you understand, so
I came back and waited. Well, my dear, just before
dawn I dozed off, but I was awake again as the sun
came up, and there wasn’t a trooper about! They’d
all gone and I determined to warn young Larry and
send him off to take his chances—but he isn’t
there. The bed has been used and he had had his
bath, but—but what has happened I fear to think.
I’m afraid Val has taken him, after all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall never want to speak to Mr. Tracy again
if he has,” Dorothea protested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you mustn’t say that, honey,” the elder
woman returned. “He must do his duty, you know.
After all they are enemies, those two, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>She broke off a little tearfully and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Could he have gotten out by the window?”
Dorothea suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I don’t know—perhaps,” Miss Imogene
replied. “I was so surprised to find him gone that
I didn’t think of anything else. He may have escaped
after all. I’m going back now to see if there
is any clew to what happened.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m coming with you,” said Dorothea, and the
two tiptoed down the hallway to Miss Imogene’s
room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He has burned something in the fireplace,” Dorothea
whispered, as she looked down at the ashes in
the grate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Clothing!” exclaimed Miss Imogene after an
inspection. “I wonder what he has worn away?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you sure?” Dorothea asked, surprised,
stooping down beside her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene picked up a piece of charred cloth.
There could be no doubt about that.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s very curious,” murmured Dorothea, and
went over to the window, which she found fastened
on the inside. “And he hasn’t gone out here,
either.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s been taken by Val Tracy,” Miss Imogene
declared positively, all hope gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>This Dorothea could not well deny. It certainly
looked as if no other explanation of the young man’s
disappearance would fit the facts. The girl looked
about the room hopelessly, and her eye fell upon the
desk in the corner. Miss Imogene followed her
glance and then with a little cry ran to it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I left this open,” she said hurriedly, letting down
the lid as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was long since the compartments had been filled
with creamy sheets, gone, too, were all the luxurious
fittings. A dish of sand, a goose quill pen or two,
poke-berry ink, some home-made wafers and wallpaper
envelopes. For paper there was only a book
of household receipts which had been written upon
one side only. That was the extent of the stationery.
But on one of these sheets was a note, propped up
against the inkstand. Miss Imogene tore it open,
half frantically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear and gracious lady,” it began. “It is
neither lack of gratitude nor fear for my own skin
that takes me off without a word of thanks and farewell.
Your kindness and that of the young lady at
whose window I knocked so unceremoniously, I shall
never forget. But my presence here cannot fail to
be an embarrassment to you and a danger as well.
In happier days, perhaps, I shall see you both again,
and if I should ever be able to repay you for what
you have done for a spent and rather helpless wanderer,
believe me, I shall not fail. What fortune is
ahead of me I cannot guess. I, at least, have hope.
Always faithffully yours, Laurence Stanchfield.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now what do you make of that?” Miss Imogene
questioned. “Has he escaped or hasn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should think he was going to try it,” Dorothea
replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But he couldn’t, with all those troopers about
the house!” Miss Imogene exclaimed. “And yet
he talks as if he expected to be all right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps he didn’t know they were there till afterwards,”
Dorothea suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s it!” Miss Imogene agreed; “and yet I
don’t think he would have tried to go without looking
out of the window at least, and he could have seen
their camp-fires on every side. And then he would
have had a chance to add a postscript or—or—”</p>

<p class='c012'>She stopped in perplexity, looking at the girl before
her as if asking a word of encouragement, but
she shook her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All we can do is to wait and see what Val Tracy
says.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I know Val, he won’t say anything,” Miss
Imogene declared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But some one will know,” Dorothea insisted.
“They couldn’t capture a man who was trying to
escape without any one hearing of it. I should have
thought we would have heard the noise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s true, too,” Miss Imogene admitted. “I
am usually like a cat, yet I didn’t catch a sound, not
even of the troopers riding away. I did fall asleep
for a few minutes. However, I know a struggle
would have waked me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All we can do is to wait,” Dorothea repeated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And not say a word,” Miss Imogene added, and
so it was agreed. Dorothea went back to her room
and, taking Miss Imogene’s advice to sleep longer
if she could, slipped back into bed again.</p>

<p class='c012'>When she opened her eyes once more Harriot was
sitting on the edge of the bed, cross-legged, gazing
down at her unwinkingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t say a word,” she protested the moment
Dorothea’s eyes were opened. “I promised mother
I wouldn’t wake you and I didn’t. I just looked at
you—and it was funny to see you squirm.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea stretched and yawned luxuriously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it very late?” she asked a little conscience-stricken.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no,” Harriot assured her. “Hardly anybody
is up but me, except of course, Val Tracy.
He’s always out at daybreak with his troop. But
he’s in a fine temper this morning. Somebody stole
his best horse right out of our stable.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea sat up in bed, suddenly very wide awake.
She knew of one who had need of a horse and she
wondered if any one else would share her suspicions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who do you suppose borrowed it?” she asked
innocently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know,” Harriot answered promptly.
“Val insists that it must be one of the negroes in the
neighborhood who is taking his freedom and wants
to get away. I don’t think that’s it, but of course
you can’t tell. It might be Lee Hendon, for all we
know. They say he’s out-laying, and he may want to
get over into Tennessee. But of course I wouldn’t
tell Val that. When he stops treating me like a
child, I’ll help him to find his old horse, but not before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea found in this much food for thought.
For one thing she felt certain that Val Tracy’s
natural suspicion would fall upon the man who was
thought to have escaped from Andersonville and to
be in the neighborhood of the May house, if not
actually in it. If he had not seen them the night before
with young Stanchfield, this would be his natural
conclusion. And, if he had seen them, there was
only one interpretation to put upon his inaction.
Val, himself, had helped the man to escape, furnishing
him with a good horse for that purpose. This
brought the question, “Why should he have done
such a thing?” To Dorothea’s thinking there was
only one explanation. Val Tracy was the mysterious
Red String. That would make clear much that had
puzzled her. She had previously taken for granted
that this unknown person was a woman because
Stanchfield had evidently thought so. Now she
wondered where Tracy wore his tell-tale badge and
determined to look for it at the first opportunity.
She would have liked to have a talk with Miss
Imogene, but Lucy opened the door with her breakfast
tray and put an end to her reflections.</p>

<p class='c012'>After breakfast she and Harriot went down stairs
together, and as they descended the sounds of impatient
horses and of men stamping about the gallery
jingling their spurs and accouterments drew them
to the front door. Lieutenant Tracy and his troop
were back again, but evidently preparing to leave at
once, and the sight of them put another alarming
thought into Dorothea’s mind. Suppose, after all,
she was mistaken and that instead of Tracy’s helping
Stanchfield he was then and there preparing to hunt
him down? This suggestion brought a sharp catch
at her heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tracy himself seemed in anything but a good
humor and greeted the two with a gruff “good morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are you off to?” Harriot inquired innocently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hunting!” he answered shortly, then turning to
Dorothea, “Won’t you wish me luck?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That depends upon what you are to hunt,” she
answered quickly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is only one quarry in war-times,” he answered
shortly, and snapping his sword to his belt
he ran down the steps and mounted his horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea’s eyes followed him and it came into
her mind that after all he was going upon a dangerous
errand and might not come back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish you a safe return,” she called up to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>He glanced down at her quickly, and a bright smile
came over his face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith, that’s a better wish than the other,” he
cried, gayly. “It will take a fine lot of Yankees to
keep me away if you’re wanting me to come back!”
And with a smile he rode off at the head of his troop.</p>

<p class='c012'>The girls looked after them and Dorothea felt a
little glow of warmth in her heart at Val’s words.
Perhaps, after all, he did value her good wishes for
his safe return and, yes, she admitted to herself that
she did not want anything to happen to him. And
there had been a good deal of earnestness in his tone,
as if indeed he had meant what he said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s a great blarneyer is Val Tracy,” Harriot
remarked calmly. “He seems to think that every
girls wants him to be in love with her. Such silliness!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea did not reply to this observation. She
looked after the troop till it was out of sight, then
turned back into the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s come over you all of a sudden?” Harriot
demanded. “You look as if you’d lost your
best friend.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nonsense!” Dorothea declared, but her cousin
was not convinced.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not until well on in the afternoon that
Dorothea saw Miss Imogene alone and then there
was a little satisfaction to be gotten out of talking
things over. The elder lady could offer no solution
to the problems that perplexed them both. Whether
Val Tracy had helped Stanchfield to escape or
whether, on the other hand, he was at that moment
trying to effect his capture they neither of them could
determine. There was plenty of evidence to confirm
either conclusion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All we can do is to wait till Val comes back,”
Miss Imogene remarked disconsolately.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But even then we may not be able to tell, unless
he says something about it,” Dorothea replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is true too, honey,” Miss Imogene conceded.
“But there is nothing else for it. I only
pray the boy has escaped. It was a bold move to
take Val’s horse, but it was only boldness that offered
a chance of escape.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But we thought Val had helped him,” Dorothea
suggested, and Miss Imogene, nodding her head in
agreement, replied,</p>

<p class='c012'>“We only hoped, honey, but it was most improbable.
At all events we don’t know anything, we’ll
just have to wait.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The day passed slowly enough. Harriot attached
herself to Dorothea but complained that her cousin
wasn’t like herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I bring you cake and you just nibble it as if you
were at a party being polite,” she protested. “Then
I beg Aunt Decent to make some goober pralines and
you don’t even look at them. You’re getting just
like April.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea forced a laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s a compliment,” she said with as much
gayety of manner as she could muster.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, is it?” Harriot drawled scornfully.
“Well, I didn’t mean it that way. If growing up
means just falling in love, then—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are you talking about?” Dorothea interrupted
sharply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You,” Harriot answered blandly, munching one
of the scorned pralines energetically. “I’ve been
puzzling my head, trying to think who it could be.
Of course there’s Val Tracy, but ’most everybody
thinks he’s in love with April, and ’most everybody
is, so I don’t be—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Stop talking nonsense!” Dorothea broke in
again. “I’m not in love with anybody.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hum!” murmured Harriot doubtfully. “I
don’t know anything else that would take your appetite
away, and you needn’t deny it’s gone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It seems to me I’ve been eating ever since you
woke me up this morning,” Dorothea protested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t wake you up,” Harriot insisted, thus
changing the subject much to Dorothea’s delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>But as the hours wore on she became more and
more anxious for Val’s return and when in the early
evening she heard a horseman ride rapidly up to the
front of the house she was the first on the porch to
welcome him. It was not Tracy, however, but Hal,
and he brought information that was by no means
welcome.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’re ordered off!” he announced.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had little more to tell than that. Tracy was
already on the move and they need not expect to see
him for a long time to come. The Confederate
Government was combing the country for men and
big events were expected. Hal gave his meager
news and was off again ere they realized it, and the
household settled down to await events.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s the way it goes,” Mrs. May sighed as
they sat at the table that night and looked about
at the empty places. “In the morning the house is
full. In the evening we are deserted. We women
haven’t the easiest part in some ways.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is the misfortune of being born a girl,”
April said bitterly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have our place, too, honey,” Miss Imogene
replied with a gentle rebuke in her tone. “I think
our men need us just as we are. Fighting isn’t just
letting off guns.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I might take the place of a man who won’t
fight!” April burst out and, jumping to her feet,
she left the room amid a hush that lasted some little
time after she had gone. All knew of whom she was
thinking, and the rest of the meal was eaten in comparative
silence.</p>

    <div>CONFIDENCES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was many months before Dorothea saw Val
Tracy again and in the quiet days that followed
the departure of all the men in the May household,
she and Miss Imogene often speculated over
what had happened to young Larry Stanchfield.
There was no answer to their problem, but this common
secret brought a close intimacy between the
two.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not to be wondered at that the girl should
find her heart drawn to this gentle, white-haired little
lady; and the elder woman, perhaps because of her
past memories, took a special interest in the child
of her old friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene, looking back upon the days of her
girlhood, regarded the life about her with the kindly
eyes of that romantic time. Indeed the love affairs
of the young people she knew seemed to interest
her more than the momentous events that were happening
in the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>Stirring tales of Forrest’s raids, or of victory
nearer home, such as the brilliant Confederate General
Johnston’s defeat of Palmer, which roused April
to wild enthusiasm, drew from her only an anxious
inquiry about one or other of the young officers whose
love secrets had been poured into her sympathetic
ear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wouldn’t like anything to happen to Bennie
Hardee till he had made it up with Myrtle Clay,”
she would murmur anxiously; or, knitting her brows,
“Every General ought to talk seriously to his young
officers about writing home the minute a battle is
over. Emmie Polk hasn’t heard from Will Cary
and she is half crazy with anxiety.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If Cousin Immie had her way all love stories
would have a happy ending,” April had said and
turned away, half bitterly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene watched her go, then addressing
Dorothea with a sigh, “It is so easy to miss the
best things in life,” she told her. “When we are
young how little we know where our real happiness
lies. And, oh, how foolish are those who will not
listen to what their hearts tell them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea knew well enough that Miss Imogene
was thinking of April. The elder lady did not conceal
the fact that she had little patience with her
beautiful cousin’s attitude toward Lee Hendon,
though she was wise enough not to force her opinions
upon the girl herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When one has missed the greatest happiness because
of a coquettish whim—ah, then, my dear, a
lifetime of regret is hard to bear,” she went on. “I
know what I am talking about, Dorothea, my child.
You remember Larry Stanchfield?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, indeed,” Dorothea answered. “I’ve never
ceased to wonder what has happened to him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And perhaps you noticed, honey, that when I
discovered who he was I was quite ready to set him
safely on his way?” Miss Imogene asked with a
gentle smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You said it was because of an old friendship,”
Dorothea replied, wondering what was coming.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was more than a friendship,” Miss Imogene
admitted, looking off into the distance as if she pictured
again the well-remembered scene from out of
the past. “To think that he might have been my
son, if—if I had not been so foolish a maid. I
would not listen to my heart. Shall I tell you about
it, dear?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please do,” Dorothea murmured.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It may serve as a warning to you, child,” Miss
Imogene continued in her sweet gentle voice. “That
boy’s father and I—well, he was madly in love with
me and I with him. His name was Laurence, too;
‘Larry,’ I called him, and he came from up North,
from Albany in New York State. I met him while
he was visiting in Charleston, and, my dear, I say
it without vanity, I was something of a toast in those
days. Yes, I had many lovers and all would bend to
my slightest whims. All but Larry—who was a
man. He would not bend, and so—so I sent him
off, but I never forgot him nor did any other come
to take his place in my heart. Perhaps it was because
he would not bend. It isn’t the man you can
twist around your finger, honey, that you remember
the longest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What did you want of him that he wouldn’t do?”
Dorothea asked after a pause.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing very much, it seemed to me at the time,”
Miss Imogene replied, “but now I know that I asked
him to sacrifice a principle, and that he would not do,
even for me whom he loved. I know he did love me
then—you remember that I said he was from the
North.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But there wasn’t any war then,” Dorothea interrupted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, there wasn’t; but Larry was an Abolitionist
even in those days,” Miss Imogene explained. “To
tease him I said that I should give my husband one
of my negro boys for a body-servant. I thought
what a fine joke it would be to make him a slave
owner, little knowing that my whole happiness was at
stake. And, honey, he refused my gift! So we
parted—and to-day his son is fighting for the very
Cause over which we quarreled twenty years ago.
And I—I have lost over twenty years of happiness.
All the slaves in the world were not worth it,
and I knew it at the time; but I had a foolish pride
and thought that no one should refuse me what I
wanted. I have missed the best in life for a silly
whim and when I see others about me who are running
the same risk, I long to take them in my arms
and whisper my story in their ears. I do not mean
you, dear,” Miss Imogene ended, with a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea knew to whom Miss Imogene referred,
but she kept that knowledge to herself. Thereafter,
however, she understood better why April’s
affairs were of such vital interest to her cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>But love affairs were not the only matters these
two discussed. As the weeks passed Dorothea grew
to know more intimately the causes of the war between
the North and the South and many perplexing
questions entered her mind. Her sympathy for the
Confederacy she had taken for granted; but, with
an increasing knowledge of the actual conditions, she
began to think for herself and, being an English girl,
she was free from the prejudices that would have
hampered the cool judgment of one born in America.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was very glad to find that she could talk freely
with Miss Imogene, who, although none doubted her
loyalty, showed, to Dorothea at least, some understanding
of the Union point of view.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know, honey,” Miss Imogene began upon
one occasion, “I was at home in Charleston when
this war broke out. It was my own State that began
it, and perhaps if it hadn’t been for the lesson Larry
Stanchfield had taught me I should have been as bitter
as the other females who clamored for States’ rights
and longed to see the old flag torn down at Fort
Sumter. As it was, I had already determined to set
all my negroes free; but I couldn’t do it all at once,
either for their sakes or for my own. No, my dear,
I had first to have them taught trades so that they
could take care of themselves, and then I had to let
them go secretly, one at a time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why, Cousin Imogene?” Dorothea asked,
puzzled at this. “They belonged to you, didn’t
they? You could do as you pleased with them,
couldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, honey, but the feeling against freeing slaves
was very marked,” Miss Imogene explained. “Particularly
when the war began.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the war wasn’t because of slavery,” Dorothea
objected. “It was because of secession. That
is what we all thought in England.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is what we all said it was,” Miss Imogene
agreed, “but the address that South Carolina sent
to the other states invited them to form a ‘Confederacy
of Slave-holding States.’ They are the very
words, my dear—and then it went on to say that
the North did not like slavery and would stop it
sooner or later. It did not give one good reason for
secession. I know, because I read it. I reckon I’m
the only Southern woman who did!” She laughed
a little as she ended.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would it have made any difference if they had
read it?” Dorothea asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not a mite, honey,” Miss Imogene answered
cheerfully. “We were all past reasoning, then.
Every one was just swept along on one grand wave
of excitement. There was martial music, and new
uniforms; shouting, singing, sobbing—just anything
to keep the war-fever up to its highest pitch. Nobody
wanted to think. They just wanted to feel.
It was all as contagious as the measles. And they
believed in Toombs next to the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It isn’t quite easy to understand,” Dorothea said
thoughtfully. “You’d think going to war was a
serious matter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so it is, honey,” Miss Imogene replied,
“and that’s the reason why nobody did any thinking
in those days. The politicians wanted the war,
General Toombs and such men didn’t want anybody
to do anything but shout for secession. And there
were sad things and funny things a-plenty, too. I
saw the old flag go down on Fort Sumter. That did
not seem sad to me then, though when I learned
later that the fort had been evacuated and not surrendered,
I confess I felt a throb of pride.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What were the funny things?” asked Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, there were the newspapers,” Miss Imogene
went on. “All the dispatches from the North
were printed under the heading ‘Foreign News.’
Just silly pretenses like that, which the politicians
encouraged. But I’m silly, too, to be going over an
old story.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you were always for the South, Cousin Imogene,”
Dorothea remarked half-questioningly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To be sure, honey,” came the ready answer.
“I was no different from the others. And what
else could I do? My home was here. I had no
kin outside the South, and besides I was not accustomed
to traveling without a gentleman escort. I’m
not a strong-minded female, you know.” She
laughed a little. “After all I’m just like the others
you have met here, except that I learned a lesson
when I wasn’t very old which has set me thinking.
I don’t like war at all and shall be very glad when
this one is over, as I hope it soon will be. But I
don’t say that to any one but you. Particularly not
to April.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The life in the May household, of which Dorothea
had become a permanent part, went on busily week
after week. There were alternating periods of depression
and elation as rumors of good or bad fortune
for the Confederate armies reached the little
town. But no matter whether they won or lost, the
confidence of her Southern cousins never flagged.
The social gayeties continued unabated, although
the lack of young men emphasized the cause of their
absence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose you’d have us act like the Yanks had
scared us till we forgot how to dance,” Harriot told
Dorothea, echoing the opinion generally held by those
about her.</p>

<p class='c012'>And so the songs and merriment went on, and if
there was a hollow ring in the laughter Dorothea
was not able to detect it. The sherbets might be
sweetened with watermelon sugar, the cake made of
sorghum and rice flour, dresses might be re-dyed
and refurbished till they were thread-bare; but the
dances and parties never flagged.</p>

<p class='c012'>Letters from her father had come several times to
Dorothea, some by way of Mexico, others in a
roundabout way from Canada, but he had warned
her that it was becoming increasingly difficult to communicate
with her, that few of her letters sent
through his agents in England ever reached him.
He suggested that in case of necessity a personal
item in the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> which coöoperated
with the <i>New York Daily News</i> would be forwarded
to him. Meanwhile both must rest assured that no
news was good news.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Stewart remained in little Washington although
she still talked of instant flight, and one day
late in May she was visiting her sister-in-law and discussing
the matter as if it were an entirely new
subject.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What I maintain,” she insisted, “is that there
is no future for us here any longer. Even if we win
the war, our good old Wilkes County families have
been humiliated to the depths. I have seen my own
child eat clabber from a cracked plate.” She looked
about her, doubtless expecting groans from sympathetic
relatives.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did it have cinnamon and sugar on it?” demanded
Harriot. “Aunt Decent gives most of
ours to the babies, but I just love it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They were interrupted at that moment by the
sound of a horse trotting up the drive and Harriot
ran out to see who it was.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, mother, here’s Hal!” she called, and a moment
later the young man himself walked in.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was lean and worn-looking and his mother
gazed at him anxiously as she took him in her arms.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have bad news, I fear,” she murmured.
“Is it your father?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have heard from him since I have,” he answered
quickly. “No, mother, there’s no personal
misfortune to tell. All our kin have come through
safely. Val Tracy has been made a Captain and is
as well as you can expect. But I fear he’s hungry,
or in love. He hasn’t been cheerful a minute since
we left here.” He was striving to speak lightly, but
his mother saw through the pretense.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is something troubling you, dear,” she
insisted. “I can tell by your face that something
is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hal shrugged his shoulders and half turned away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The fact is,” he said, after a slight pause, “the
Yanks are getting a little too near to suit me. We
hoped to hold them at Chattanooga, but you know
what happened there!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going home to pack <i>now</i>!” Mrs. Stewart
exclaimed, rising majestically to her feet. “Come,
Corinne. We should have started for Mexico long
ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’d better hear Hal’s news before you go,”
Mrs. May suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Aunt Cora,” Hal went on with the ghost
of a smile. “You’ll have to decide on Brazil.
Sherman has the jump on you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You mean we’re cut off?” cried Mrs. Stewart in
anguish.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, not entirely,” Hal answered, laughing at
her exaggerated despair. “You can at least get
out of Washington; but, if you’re going, I shouldn’t
advise delay. Sherman isn’t one to lose time, and
when he tears up a railroad he does it completely.
He builds a great fire with the ties and heats the
rails till they’re red-hot and twists them around
trees. ‘Jeff Davis’ neckties,’ he calls them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A very poor joke indeed!” Mrs. Stewart remarked
with dignity. “I do not know what kind of
neckties our good President Davis wears, but I am
sure they are not twisted around trees.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a laugh at this sally, at which Mrs.
Stewart looked still more dignified and important,
but Hal spoke directly to his mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Seriously,” he went on, “I have really come to
warn you that it is best you should leave Washington.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s quite impossible, Hal,” his mother answered
quietly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t say that yet,” he went on earnestly. “Of
course there’s nothing positive in war and it may be
that we shall give the Yanks a good beating after all;
but to tell you the truth I don’t expect it. At any
rate Sherman is in Georgia, and he doesn’t stand
still!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall not go, in any circumstances,” Mrs. May
replied firmly. “I do not believe the war has
changed the Union officers into monsters. If we
stay here we shall be respected even if the Yankees
do come. I feel sure an empty house is much more
likely to be a prey to stragglers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps your mother is right, Hal,” Mrs. Stewart
put in anxiously, her uncertainty again getting the
better of her. “I have heard that there were a few
really nice people in the North in spite of everything.
I never quite believed it until I met a Mrs. Biddle
from Philadelphia at the White Sulphur who was
really quite a cultivated female. Though to be sure
her mother was from Baltimore, which may account
for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am certain it is best to stay,” Miss Ivory cut in
upon Mrs. Stewart with scant ceremony. “A party
of ladies will be perfectly safe, no matter who gets
the upper hand. But, Parthenia, my dear, if you
have a wish to take the children and the servants to
the Magnolia plantation I’ll stay here till you return.
I can get along with Sally and Aunt Decent
and one or two of the younger girls. We could
manage nicely.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Imogene,” said Mrs. May, “it’s sweet of
you to suggest it, but I have many reasons for staying.
One of the best is that here I am half way
between Hal and his father and can go to either one
of them in case of need or have them brought home.
So here I’ll stay. As to the girls, I think they’re
perfectly safe. As a matter of fact, Hal,” she went
on, turning directly to her son, “I cannot see what
would take the Northern army in this direction.
We have no iron mines or large manufactories.
There are no supply depots to tempt an invader to
Washington.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now that is indeed a thought, ’Thenia,” her
sister-in-law interjected. “You have almost persuaded
me to stay with you. But I always have in
mind what the conditions are likely to be after the
war. Of course you may expect that the North
will find some pretext for getting even for Andersonville.
They will probably put thousands of our
bravest boys in prison, <i>literally thousands</i>. As to
our valuables,” she lifted her brows with a superior
expression, “I know what to do with them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You had best send them over here if you are determined
to go away,” Mrs. May suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed no, my dear,” was the answer, “I shall
put them in a safer place still. Judge Andrews will
care for them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But he’s a Yankee—or as good as one!” Harriot
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly,” her aunt went on. “He is a man
with convictions, and I always have an admiration
for a person who will stand up for his opinions.
When all of you scorned him, I had ever a pleasant
word for him. Of course I could not openly associate
with him, in the circumstances, but I am sure he
knows my sympathy. Now you see what I gain by
looking ahead a little, and having a kind word to
say to one in adversity. I shall have a safe place
for my valuables, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Ivory emitted a lady-like little snort of contempt
and Cora turned to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I know how intolerant you are, Imogene!”
she said, with a touch of anger in her voice. “But
I can’t afford to be selfish. I have a daughter to
provide for. For her sake I must curb my pride and
take help where I can find it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Saying which she again rose and, giving every one
the impression that she had been deeply injured,
quitted the house, followed by Corinne, who took
her cue from her mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am glad that a wise providence put it out of
my power to marry a woman like that,” Miss Imogene
said softly. “I do not quite understand how
Charles Stewart has permitted her to live this long.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t bother about her,” Hal interjected.
“She’ll do as she pleases anyway, and no amount of
advice will move her. And you can remember, too,
that she isn’t the only one in the South who has been
‘looking ahead,’ as she calls it. There are thousands
who are trying to prepare a place in the other
camp, in case worst comes to worst.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” April, who up to that moment had scarcely
said a word, now cried bitterly. “There are too
many carrying water on both shoulders, and that is
why people are beginning to talk about our losing.
I did not expect it of you, Hal,” she ended, with a
straight look at her brother.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can only see what the plain facts are, sis,” he
answered. “Sherman has a hundred thousand men
and we have less than fifty thousand. What are we
going to do against such odds?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do!” cried April in a ringing voice. “We’re
going to fight till they’re beaten. There’s nothing
else we can do!” At the words the young girl
seemed transfigured. “A victory! A victory!”
she cried, and running to the piano she started singing
“Dixie.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But for once she failed to carry her audience with
her. “What is the matter with you-all?” she demanded,
standing up pale but defiant beside the
piano. “Are we to be beaten by talk? If we all
grow glum when everything is not going right how
can we expect to win? We wouldn’t deserve to win.
The Yankees have twice as many men as we have,
you say. Well, we have Johnston! He’ll stop
Sherman if he only had quarter what he has. We
shall win in spite of all the croaking and croakers!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was half beside herself for the moment, almost
hysterical, and realizing it, or perhaps fearing
that she would break down and cry, she quitted the
room in haste.</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot began to sob from excitement and sympathy
for the sister she adored, and Dorothea put an
arm about her comfortingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot looked at her cousin through her tears.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think you care at all,” she murmured, and
Dorothea was surprised to find that there was some
truth in the words. At least she did not find herself
sorrowing over the waning fortunes of the South.</p>

    <div>A DISTRESSING INCIDENT</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Hal May remained at home only two days,
but in that time his old uniform was patched
and Aunt Decent plied him with food until
he pleaded lack of room for more, so that when he
went away he had perceptibly improved in appearance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Again the May household settled down to the
humdrum business of waiting for news of the armies.
And Sherman’s march through Georgia gave the
people of little Washington many anxious moments,
though it soon became apparent that their town
would escape and that after Atlanta, Savannah was
the chief objective of the Federal expedition.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of Val Tracy there was scarcely a word. He
seemed to have dropped out of sight, but not out of
the minds of his friends. Dorothea, remembering
the last time she had seen him mount his horse and
ride away, wondered often what was happening to
him. She and Miss Imogene talked much of the
young Irishman and speculated also upon the fortune
of young Stanchfield whose whereabouts were
still unknown to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea had grown to be one of the family and
her aunt treated her as if she were another daughter.
Harriot was her devoted slave, and at first April
had shown a fondness for her English cousin, which
she had been quick to return. But there was none
of the close intimacy between the two that Dorothea
would have welcomed.</p>

<p class='c012'>And the cause of this was not far to seek. Even
Dorothea realized that a certain change had come in
her feelings toward the rights and wrongs of the
war. It was impossible for her to respond to
April’s enthusiastic support of everything the Confederacy
represented. Nor could she condemn the
North in all things with the fervor April expected of
those who claimed sympathy with the South. Always
there was the remembrance of her visit to Mr.
Lincoln. When she heard the Union execrated with
unmeasured bitterness she pictured in her mind the
tall, gentle man in Washington into whose eyes she
had looked. There she had read the truth, and
knew that he had none of the sordid qualities that
were attributed to him by his unreasoning enemies.
Dorothea did not believe that he could be wrong in
his efforts to solve the great problems confronting
him, for she knew that his heart held a great sympathy
for the South.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus as the summer passed she began to realize
that a change was taking place in her thoughts about
the conflict. And at about the same time she felt
that her relations with April had grown strained.
She only became aware of it gradually when she
noted that her beautiful cousin was apt to leave the
room where she was. There were no longer any of
the little demonstrations of affection that had marked
their earlier intimacy. Constantly she caught April’s
eyes upon her as if she was watched with suspicion.
There was no act or word that Dorothea could lay
hold of, yet all the time she realized a widening of
the breach between them.</p>

<p class='c012'>One rainy morning in the Autumn, Dorothea had
gone out on the porch to look for some sign of
clearing weather, when her attention was attracted
by two drenched figures coming slowly up the drive
toward the house. They were colored servants, one
an old woman and the other quite a lad, and they
were in a truly pitiable state. They were soaked
through and their clothing clung to them, dripping
water as they walked.</p>

<p class='c012'>At sight of Dorothea they hastened their steps and,
arriving at the porch, begged to be permitted to see
“Ol’ Miss.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea brought them in out of the wet and went
in search of her aunt, whom she found in the weaving-room.
Together they returned to the porch, and at
sight of the forlorn couple Mrs. May gave an exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, Aunt Dilsey, is it you?” she cried.
“What brings you here on a day like this?”</p>

<p class='c012'>For answer the old woman threw herself on her
knees at Mrs. May’s feet, her brown face working
convulsively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sam and me—we’s done run away!” she
sobbed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Run away?” echoed Mrs. May as if she could
scarcely believe her ears. “Nonsense, Aunt Dilsey!
You can’t run away. You’re one of the
family.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes’m, I is,” the old woman moaned, “but we-all’s
jes’ ’bliged to run away, and we knows the
patrollers will be out after us. That’s why we-all
done come hehe. I’s been mighty proud all my days.
I’s always said, ‘Dilsey can tote heh own skillet,’
but please, Ol’ Miss, Dilsey can’t tote no skillet no
mo’.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman rocked herself with grief and Mrs. May
looked down upon her pityingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get up, Dilsey,” she said after a moment. “I
don’t know what you’re talking about. If you can’t
explain, let Sam do it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The old colored woman continued to mumble unintelligibly
till at last Mrs. May silenced her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, Sam,” she said, turning to the boy, “what
is the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Somewhat sullenly Sam found his tongue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ouah Ol’ Miss, she’s aimin’ to sell me down the
river to Savannah,” he began, “and Granny, heah,
she don’t like it nohow, and I don’t like it nohow
neither, so I’s aimin’ to run away up North an’ be
free.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t believe a word of it,” Mrs. May replied
incredulously. “You two go into the kitchen and
visit Aunt Decent and dry yourselves. I’ll send you
back home. Mrs. Stewart doesn’t sell her servants.
It’s absurd.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ouah Ol’ Miss done sold Casper and Manders
to a man from Macon no later’n yestehday, Miss
’Thenia,” Sam insisted doggedly. “They’re done
gone a’ready. If I’s done got to go away from
Granny I’s goin’ No’th whehe I’ll be free—less’n
the houn’s catch me first.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea had watched her aunt’s face grow
graver and graver as she heard these words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot believe what you are saying, Sam,”
she replied, though her tone was not so positive now.
“How could it have happened? Have the boys
been stealing or disobedient?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No’m,” the lad answered readily. “This man
from Macon, he wanted carpenters, and he was ready
to pay for ’em in gold, Miss ’Thenia. So ouah Ol’
Miss she done sol’ ’em, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“An’ now she’s aimin’ to sell Sam, too, the onlies’
one of my Dilly’s pickaninnies what I done raise to
comfort me. Please, Miss ’Thenia, buy us bofe.
We’ll work for you till we drops. Honest we will,
and we’ll—”</p>

<p class='c012'>The old woman’s voice trailed off into uncontrollable
sobs.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is certainly some mistake,” Mrs. May
said, turning to Dorothea. “Would you mind,
dear, fetching April for me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea ran off and soon returned with her
cousin, to whom the situation was explained at once.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is some misunderstanding, of course,”
Mrs. May ended, “but it is not a matter that can be
delayed. It must be settled at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’d better let me go, mother,” April suggested.
“I can’t believe Aunt Cora could possibly
do what Aunt Dilsey thinks, and it’s very wet for
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, I will leave Sam and Aunt Dilsey for you to
look after,” Mrs. May replied significantly, and it
was plain to April that she did not wish their story
to be repeated throughout the quarters by the two.
“I’ll take Dorothea with me and go over to Cora’s.
Send one of the boys to tell Jastrow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>April with Aunt Dilsey and Sam in tow disappeared.
The carriage was ready almost as soon as
Mrs. May and Dorothea, and once on their way the
girl ventured to ask something about Aunt Dilsey and
her grandson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She was Mother May’s cook when I was first
married,” Mrs. May explained. “Your Aunt Cora,
who was married some years later, always lived
with her mother till the old lady died, so it was natural
that she should inherit all the old house servants.
Aunt Dilsey’s children are all dead too, and Sam is
her only kin; so you see why she dreads to be separated
from him. It is quite unheard of with us to
separate families by selling them, and I am quite sure
that there is some mistake. I am only going over
now to make certain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea hoped that this might be the case. This
question of slave-owning had puzzled wiser heads
than hers, but so far she had seen the best side of the
matter. The May servants were fortunate, in that
their owners had their interests wholly at heart, indeed
Dorothea frequently observed that the child-like
negroes took advantage of this indulgence. On the
other hand she had heard talk of hard masters who
worked their slaves without consideration; those
with whom she had been associated condemned this
quite frankly, though as a body they felt that they
must uphold the practice of slave-owning no matter
what its abuses might be. Indeed they were quite
sincere in their belief that their people were unfit to
take care of themselves and dreaded the future for
them in case the Federal Cause should triumph.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, however, the seriousness of the question was
coming very near to Dorothea. Right in the family
was the possibility of a cruel separation. Whatever
Mrs. Stewart might have done, and whether she had
sold her servants or not, it was quite clear to Dorothea’s
keen mind that she had the power to do so,
and that in itself did not seem right. Mrs. Stewart
might be just as thoughtful of those who were dependent
upon her as was Aunt Parthenia, but she
was sure there must be many throughout the South
who would have no such consideration for the unfortunates
over whom the law gave them absolute
control.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they swept into the drive at Crosslands, Uncle
Jastrow turned in his seat and addressed his mistress.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I on’y hopes, Ol’ Miss,” he said, referring to
the mud that had accumulated on the running gear
of the carriage, “that none of the fambly is gwine
to see we-all comin’ into the place lookin’ like
this.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No one will blame you for the state of the roads,
Uncle Jastrow,” she said.</p>

<p class='c012'>But this did not placate the old man.</p>

<p class='c012'>“These hosses and this cahhiage don’t look like
they eveh seen a currycomb nor yet a shammy,” he
grunted, and drove up to the house with the air of a
martyr at the stake.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May and Dorothea were ushered into the
parlor, where they found Corinne and her mother
busy counting gold pieces. On hearing the door
open Mrs. Stewart hastily swept some of the stacks
of coin into her bag, whereat Corinne was moved to
protest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now I’ll have to count them all over again, and
it’s only Aunt ’Thenia and Dorothea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Both greeted their visitors with great warmth,
Corinne inquiring for Harriot, (left at home with
a visiting governess, much to that young lady’s disgust,)
and her mother rejoicing at the timelessness of
the visit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For really, my dear ’Thenia, I need your advice,”
she began at once though she was never known
to follow any advice, no matter from what source.
“I have just learned how heavy gold is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t know there was so much gold left in the
Confederacy,” Mrs. May returned, striving to
speak lightly. The sight of the yellow coins seemed
to confirm all that the colored boy, Sam, had said.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Stewart wagged her head sagely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not easy to make people produce it,” she
remarked, “but if you have something they want
very much and won’t sell for anything else—well,
you see?” She pointed proudly to the table.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And have you been selling your diamonds?”
Mrs. May asked. She did not wish her sister-in-law
to know that she had heard a tale she was loath
to believe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no,” was the ready answer. “I’ve just disposed
of two of the boys, Casper and Manders.”
She spoke so indifferently that Dorothea looked at
her in amazement. She had always thought her a
silly woman, but she could not believe her so utterly
heartless.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought Charles had encouraged Manders to
marry,” Mrs. May remarked calmly, concealing her
disapproval. “But I suppose you sold his wife with
him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Stewart pushed back her chair fretfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear Parthenia, these are not times when one
may consult one’s feelings,” she replied irritably.
“I must do the best I can. The man who bought
Manders would not have his wife, and so there was
nothing possible but to separate them. Charles has
sent me word to realize on anything I can and not to
take payment in Confederate money. If I can’t get
coin I am to take State notes. And I was feeling
mighty proud of my bargain till you came
along.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But now that I am here,” Mrs. May urged, “I
hope I can persuade you to give this gentleman back
his money and tell him you have decided not to
separate families. You know it has never been the
custom in our family.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No—nor have civil wars been the custom—nor
have any of the family had to face going to live
in a strange country!” Mrs. Stewart burst out wrathfully.
“Here it wouldn’t so much matter if we were
poor, because every one else will be poor too, and
they all know we’re Mays. But how do I know the
Mexicans ever heard of Wilkes County? I am
simply obliged to have money enough to keep up
appearances. And besides, what’s the odds what I
do with these negroes of ours? The war will set
them free sooner or later. It’s a sort of a Yankee
trick, but I think I’m rather clever to find any one to
buy them. I didn’t believe I could, till I heard of
this man from Macon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The cleverness of the bargain was not all that was
interesting Mrs. May.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Suppose, as you say, the war ends and the slaves
are freed,” she said genially; “don’t you realize that
families once separated may never meet again?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When they’re free they’ll have to learn to look
out for themselves. And if I wanted to, I couldn’t
get the boys back now,” Mrs. Stewart replied ungraciously.
“This man who bought them wasn’t a
gentleman, you understand. He bought them because
they were good mechanics. Moreover, I don’t
know where he has sent them. It may be he is going
to sell their labor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cora!” Mrs. May cried, “I am certain Charles
never meant you to dispose of your people.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t let’s argue it, Parthenia,” Mrs. Stewart
retorted, summoning all her dignity to bolster an uneasy
conscience. “I must be the judge of what my
husband desires, and whatever I may feel personally
I put aside when I remember my daughter. I was
given full power to do as I thought best and I have
used it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May rose to leave.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I came here,” she said, with studied restraint,
“because of what I believed to be a mistake. Now
I am afraid to ask you another question—but can
it be that you propose to separate Aunt Dilsey and
Sam?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Stewart had the grace to look somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am hoping to sell Aunt Dilsey with Sam,” she
answered. “You know she’s getting on in years—but
for all that she’s a wonderful cook, and I told
the man from Macon—”</p>

<p class='c012'>A spot of red appeared in each of Mrs. May’s
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is all I wished to know,” she interrupted
abruptly. “Aunt Dilsey and Sam are at my house,
and there they shall stay. Henry, at least, would
never forgive me the shame of it if that faithful old
soul was sold to strangers in her advanced age. We
can ill-afford to take more mouths to feed, not to
speak of paying for them; but let me know the price
you propose to ask and I will see that the money
reaches you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Stewart beamed upon her sister-in-law.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now that’s just like you, ’Thenia!” she exclaimed
delightedly. “It relieves my mind of all
anxiety. Charles will never worry about Aunt Dilsey
if she is to be kept in the family. And you
needn’t bother about the money till it’s convenient.
In fact I’ve rather more gold in the house now than
I know what to do with. Good-by, my dear. I’m
so glad you came. I confess I was a little uneasy
about Aunt Dilsey and Sam, but now my mind is
quite at ease. Good-by, Dorothea, honey.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Back in the carriage again and outside the place
Mrs. May tried to make excuses for her sister-in-law,
but her own indignation could hardly be hidden.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I did not believe it possible that one of our
family could do such a thing,” she burst out finally.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But don’t you think, Aunt Parthenia,” Dorothea
said, “it would be much better if no one had the
power to buy and sell human beings?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her aunt looked at her a moment intently, then she
nodded her head a little sadly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps so, Dorothea,” she answered half to
herself. “Perhaps so.” And they drove back the
rest of the way in silence.</p>

    <div>A STRANGE ENCOUNTER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This incident of old Aunt Dilsey and Sam was
but one of many that set Dorothea to thinking
deeply. The summer had passed with
but little change in the village of Washington. September
had seen Sherman in possession of Atlanta;
he had occupied Savannah in December and a month
later began his successful march through South Carolina.
But the most significant occurrence of that
Autumn was the reëlection of Mr. Lincoln. This
was a confirmation of the unity felt in the North to
prosecute the war to the end and a blasting of the
hopes of those Southerners who, realizing their
dwindling resources, had worked to bring about some
form of compromise. The winter of 1865 was a
continued history of defeat for the Confederate
armies who opposed Sherman. Charleston was
evacuated in February, and when the Stars and
Stripes once more floated over Sumter’s ruins, it
seemed to Dorothea that the end of the war had
really come. For she developed an intense interest
in all these matters and it was hard for her to understand
how her cousins could close their eyes to the
clear meaning of events.</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene was away upon a visit to other relatives
and there was no one to whom the girl could
talk freely, so that her thoughts were in a somewhat
chaotic state. She was surprised sometimes to find
herself so eager for news of the war, as if in some
way her personal fortunes were involved. Now
and then she would say to herself that these things
made little difference to an English girl; but immediately
there came the recollection that she was half
American.</p>

<p class='c012'>A rainy spring followed a cold and dismal winter,
and although early in April the weather cleared for a
time, it brought no cheer to the South. General Lee
was near Richmond with his army, and about him
were the Union forces under Grant. The Confederacy
was making its last stand, though there were
very few in the South who would acknowledge the
condition.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the May household there was little to indicate
that a crisis existed in the cause for which they all
worked. So far the cruelties of war had passed them
by, but one bright morning Hal was brought home by
his colored body-servant, Big Jim, quite out of his
senses from a bad saber wound in the head and a
crippled leg. Mrs. May, with admirable fortitude,
welcomed him, glad to have her son back to nurse and
thanking Heaven it was no worse.</p>

<p class='c012'>Big Jim’s story of the incident reflected a good
deal of credit upon himself and he seemed immensely
proud of his successful meeting of the emergency,
and was never tired of talking about it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I drug the Lil’ Marse out o’ the battle and the
doctor he done fix him up on the road,” Jim explained.
“Den the Colonel, hisself, was brung by
wounded an’ the doctor, he had to go off wif him
so he tol’ me to carry Lil’ Marse to the horspital.
But I seen ouah sogers when they comes out of them
places wifout they’s laigs, or they’s arms, or they’s
eyes, an’ I says, ‘Big Jim, Ol’ Miss gwine for you
somethin’ turrible, if you on’y brings back chunks of
Lil’ Marse,’ so I done brung him (all o’ him, mind),
right here and didn’t go near no horspital, where like
as not they’d done ampitate his haid like they do
arms and laigs. Now you-all fix him up jes’ to suit
yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That was Big Jim’s story, and from then on the
entire household revolved about the sick-room and
even the news of battles became of secondary importance.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the afternoon Harriot, being free of her governess,
proposed to carry the news to Corinne; for
Mrs. Stewart, in spite of her many threats of immediate
departure, was still in Washington.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We may get some poundcake, you know,” Harriot
suggested as an added inducement, but there was
a lack of conviction in her tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll go if we take the short cut,” Dorothea answered,
meaning a path through a strip of woods
on the outskirts of the town, which was a most beautiful
and densely shaded place running for miles
through hill and swamp. It was a favorite resort of
Dorothea’s, and she loved to wander along the narrow
path, through the heavy undergrowth, and fancy
herself far away from civilization.</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot consented to this cheerfully enough, although
she had meant to drive to her aunt’s, and the
two set off.</p>

<p class='c012'>Corinne was not visible when they arrived, but
Mrs. Stewart welcomed them with her usual cordiality.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Make yourselves perfectly at home, my dears,”
she said in greeting. “You will excuse me, I know;
but I have so many things to do. We are leaving
’most any day now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She rambled on in this strain, coming and going
in a great bustle of excitement through the room in
which they sat, as if her departure really were imminent.
She talked just as Dorothea had heard her
talk by the hour, and so familiar was the theme that
Dorothea soon lost the thread of it, her thoughts
wandered off to other matters and she sat idly looking
out of the window, which commanded a view of
the driveway up to the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I really don’t know where Corinne is,” Mrs.
Stewart explained in one of her darts into the room.
“I think she went into the village for something, but
I can’t be sure. However, she will be home shortly,
I suppose, if she doesn’t stay longer wherever she
has gone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea smiled to herself as she heard the words,
thinking that undoubtedly Mrs. Stewart was entirely
correct in this statement; but not caring very much
whether she saw Corinne or not.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And, Harriot,” Mrs. Stewart went on, “you
might go and see if there are not some refreshments
to be had. Perhaps there is some fruit cake, but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her voice trailed off as she and the quickly responsive
Harriot left the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alone, Dorothea looked out of the window, idly
watching two people coming slowly toward the house.
As they drew nearer she recognized that one of the
pair was Corinne and beside her was a man, walking
painfully with the aid of a crutch. She had no need
to note that his tattered uniform was the Confederate
gray, for the sight of wounded soldiers struggling
back along the roads to their homes was familiar
enough. They passed through the little town daily,
singly or in groups of half a dozen, helping each
other as best they might and depending upon the
generosity of the inhabitants for their food from
day to day. Of course every one was kind to them
and they were one of the few sources of information
coming into the place.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea’s heart was touched once more, as it
had been at every encounter with these unfortunate
victims of the war, and she had the impulse to go out
to greet the man with a word of encouragement and
sympathy. But she knew Corinne well enough to
realize that she would not welcome any assistance in
her ministrations. She had no wish to share the
glory of her good deeds with any one, and, knowing
this, Dorothea kept her seat and watched the two
approach.</p>

<p class='c012'>Evidently the man was badly disabled. Each
limping step seemed a painful effort, and now and
then he would stop as if it was impossible to bear the
pain without a rest. As they drew near enough for
Dorothea to see their faces, her view was cut off by
the shrubbery and it was not until she heard Corinne’s
voice that she knew they had reached the house.
The stumbling of the wounded man mounting the
two or three steps of the porch and then the stumping
of his crutch on the board flooring, were next
audible.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sit down here and I will bring you some food,”
Corinne said, and there was the scrape of a chair as
the girl pulled it forward.</p>

<p class='c012'>The window at which Dorothea sat looked out
upon the side porch, but as she heard Corinne come
into the house and hurry through it toward the rear,
she rose and crossed the room to get a view of the
wounded man.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was sitting with his back to her, a forlorn,
shabby figure, that seemed shrunken with pain and
suffering. Again she had the impulse to go out to
him and at least say a word of what was in her
heart; but she restrained herself, knowing that
Corinne would be displeased to find her there till
after she had ministered to the man herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, as Dorothea watched, she saw that the stranger’s
head suddenly turned sharply right and left as
if he looked about him. In a moment he straightened
up and then, to her amazement, jumped noiselessly
to his feet and, without a trace of lameness,
tiptoed to the edge of the porch, evidently looking
around to see how the land lay.</p>

<p class='c012'>Instantly the girl realized that this was no ordinary
wounded soldier—that, as a matter of fact, the man
was not wounded at all—and that all the suffering
he seemed to show was a sham. And she grew indignant.
He was, in all probability, a deserter, pretending
that he was wounded in order to escape the
risks his fellows were forced to run, and at the same
time trading upon the sympathies of those who might
better have saved their charities for more worthy
objects.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He doesn’t deserve food that might be given to
really suffering soldiers,” she thought, and was about
to run out to the kitchen to tell Corinne what she
had seen.</p>

<p class='c012'>But before she had taken a step the man turned
and faced her through the window. With a catch
of her breath she recognized him at once. It was
Larry Stanchfield! He was unkempt and none too
clean. A two days’ growth of beard would have
disguised his features from his friends; but he had
been like that when Dorothea had last seen him and
there was no doubt in her mind as to who he was.
She stopped abruptly and Stanchfield, seeing her
through the window and recognizing her, lifted his
hand and beckoned her to come out to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Dorothea reached the porch, he was back
in his chair, once more the crippled Confederate
soldier.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are you doing here?” she asked in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am about to be fed against my will,” he answered,
with a grin. “The young lady insisted that
I must be taken care of. She met me on the road
and would have it that I come here and be stuffed,
although I told her I needed nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then why did you come?” demanded Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because if I had been too insistent she would
have been suspicious,” he answered. “I venture to
think that there are not many Rebel soldiers,
wounded as badly as I am, who would protest at being
taken care of by a charming young lady. And I
don’t want to be shot, you know. I’ve more important
matters to attend to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His voice was low but there was a reckless boyishness
about it that contrasted strangely with his appearance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why are you in this part of the country at
all?” Dorothea demanded again. She was worried
about him, for, having helped to save him once, she
thought it a useless risk that he should run his head
into the lion’s mouth again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am on my way South to warn our troops,” he
replied soberly. “And I haven’t much time either.
The Johnny Rebs are preparing a secret expedition
against the forces Sherman left at Savannah. It’s
a very pretty plan, and, unless I get through, it will
make trouble for us. I know the country and volunteered
to carry the word. I wanted to see you and
the charming little lady who helped me before, but
I did not believe I should be lucky enough to meet
you, as I couldn’t risk stopping at the house. I
would be miles on my road now, if it hadn’t been for
this zealous young lady. I shall have to run half
the night to make up for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He laughed quietly and looked down at his crutch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We did not know whether you had gotten away
safely or not,” Dorothea replied. “We didn’t hear
a word about it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Didn’t that Irishman tell you?” Stanchfield
asked, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Irishman!” echoed Dorothea, and it was a moment
or two before she realized that Stanchfield was
talking of Val Tracy. “Did he help you?” she demanded,
after a slight pause.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To be sure he did,” came the ready answer,
“and I took for granted he had told you all about
it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have never heard a word of you since that
night,” Dorothea informed him. She was so astounded
that her thoughts were in a whirl. “Val
had helped him after all—but why had he not told
them?” Her mind was a chaos. She could reason
nothing out.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hum, that’s funny,” Larry went on, half to himself.
“I supposed of course he had let you know.
He was a fine chap, though I must say he didn’t seem
awfully cordial about what he did; but he gave me a
good horse and set me on my way, and I didn’t think
it polite to criticize his manners.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But aren’t you running a great risk, now?”
Dorothea asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not very,” he replied lightly, “and then, if I
get into trouble, I trust I may still count upon you to
help me out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think you can count upon me again,”
Dorothea answered seriously. “I was willing to
save you from prison but I don’t think I could help
you defeat the South.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, aren’t you for the North?” Stanchfield
murmured incredulously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m British,” the girl returned, “but that hasn’t
anything to do with it. It wouldn’t be fair for me
to accept the hospitality of my aunt and cousins and
betray their Cause. Do you think it would?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you’re a Red String,” he replied, as if that
made everything all right.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but I’m not,” said Dorothea positively.</p>

<p class='c012'>The young man’s glance fell to the red velvet ribbon
on the girl’s wrist and then sought her face. He
was perplexed and a little startled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then who is the Red String? The other
lady?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no,” Dorothea replied quickly. “Miss
Imogene couldn’t be, you know. We were just sorry
for the prisoners at Andersonville. That was why
we helped you.” At that moment she was convinced
that Val Tracy was the elusive member of that mysterious
band of Northern sympathizers, but this
thought she kept to herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I suppose you will betray me now?” he
questioned. “I shouldn’t have told you of my
mission!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m neutral, or at least I ought to be,” Dorothea
replied, perplexed. “Anyway, I shan’t betray you.
Only you mustn’t expect me to help you, either.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Their conversation was interrupted by the return
of Corinne, accompanied by Mrs. Stewart and Harriot.
As Dorothea had expected, Corinne was by no
means pleased by this audience to share with her
the glory of attending “one of our wounded heroes,”
as she expressed it, and Dorothea watched the proceedings,
half fearful and half amused. Stanchfield
became again the suffering soldier and Dorothea
dared not catch his eye for fear she might laugh out-right.
It was no easy matter to keep a straight face
listening to the excessive expressions of sympathy
that Mrs. Stewart and her daughter thought appropriate
to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c012'>The farce kept up till Stanchfield could eat no more
and, with many protestations of thanks, hobbled off,
glad, Dorothea knew, to be on the road with his message
that must be delivered.</p>

<p class='c012'>On their way home Harriot complained that Dorothea
was very silent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You behave as if you were starving,” Harriot
told her, as they strolled through Coulter Woods.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea laughed and tried to take an interest in
Harriot’s chatter, but her mind was filled with perplexing
thoughts which she was trying vainly to
straighten out. The news that Stanchfield had
brought, added to her mystification. Was Val
Tracy the Red String who had eluded her so persistently?
Indeed she could find no other explanation
for his share in the young man’s first escape.
Yet it did not seem possible. Tracy was not the sort
of a fellow to sail under false colors of any sort.
She knew that he was not so bitter a foe to the Union
as the Southerners generally were. She realized
that he felt much as she did about the causes of the
war; but it would not be like him, once having committed
himself, to play the traitor, which must be the
case if indeed he was one of the Red Strings. And
yet, what other explanation was there for what he
had done?</p>

<p class='c012'>Of Stanchfield and his journey to Savannah she
thought also. This time, however, she did not seem
to have the same personal interest that had played
on her sympathies before. He was well and strong
and evidently in the way of being overfed, if his
experience at Mrs. Stewart’s was any measure of his
future treatment. Of course, he ran considerable
risk; but he seemed very sure of himself, and his
confidence inspired her with faith that he would pull
through and accomplish his mission.</p>

<p class='c012'>The matter that most perplexed her had to do
with herself. She had told him she was British and
therefore neutral in this controversy between the
North and the South. But was she? She was fast
coming to the conclusion that she was neither neutral
nor British in her feelings. She began to find the
American part of her taking a vital interest in the
things that went on about her. She was no longer a
visitor to America. She did not wish to be that.
Her mother had been an American—one of these
kindly Southern women whose charm made them a
welcome wherever they went. In her heart Dorothea
felt the stirrings of her American blood and
a nearer kinship to these aunts and cousins with
whom she had been living.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know, Harriot,” she said, after a long
silence, “I don’t think the English people know very
much about our country after all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The girl beside her looked up with wide-eyed
surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What has that to do with peanut pralines?” she
demanded. “Here I’ve been talking about really
interesting things and the first word you’ve said for
hours is something that doesn’t make any difference
one way or the other. I think you <i>must</i> be in love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea laughed outright and brought her
thoughts back to her immediate surroundings.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was just thinking aloud,” she remarked lightly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s the way I always act when I’m hungry,”
Harriot replied practically. “When we get home
I’ll get you a glass of milk or some clabber. Aunt
Decent says that’s the best thing there is for an
empty stomach.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Two days later Hal showed such marked improvement
that Dr. Hardesty rubbed his
hands with satisfaction and declared his patient
would soon be out of the woods and that all
danger was practically past. At which news Mrs.
May quietly fainted away, and April faced the double
burden of an exhausted mother and a wounded
brother. Then it was that Dorothea slipped into the
breach.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can take care of Hal,” she told April. “If
he needs anything that I cannot attend to, I promise
to call you; so you can stay with Aunt Parthenia.”
April thanked her cousin gratefully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I knew I could count on you,” she said, with
something of her old warmth of manner. “I don’t
dare to trust Harriot. She would be stuffing him
with dried persimmons, like as not, the minute my
back was turned. And the servants are no good
with sick people.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So Dorothea, feeling glad to be of use, sat down
beside the bed where Hal seemed to be lightly
sleeping.</p>

<p class='c012'>She waved a fan gently to and fro to keep away
stray flies, thinking over the months she had been in
Georgia and all that had happened in that time.
After all, in spite of the fact that she had lived near
to the battle-fields, she had not seen very much to
teach her the horrors of war. The few crippled
soldiers that wandered along the road had not come
fresh from the conflict as had Hal. The talk of
thousands fallen in this or that battle had not come
close to her before this. Now, all at once, she realized
that those thousands had each a home, just as
Hal May had, and that in each was a sorrowing
mother or sister whose heart ached at the pain or
death she could do naught to prevent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Except Val Tracy,” she said to herself. “He
says he has no kin to bother about him, and—and
poor Lee Hendon too. He hasn’t anybody, since
his mother died.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And, as if she had spoken aloud, a voice beside her
seemed to answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where did he go? Lee Hendon, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea came up straight in her chair, hardly
able to believe her ears, for it was Hal who spoke.
He was looking at her with inquiring eyes and she returned
his gaze with an expression of bewildered
amazement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What happened to Lee?” Hal demanded after
a moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea was confused. She remembered that
sick people needed to be humored but she had also
heard that they should not be allowed to talk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hadn’t I better call April?” she asked gently,
half rising from her chair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By no means,” Hal answered positively. “I
don’t want her, above all people, to know of this.
Tell me, what happened to Lee? Was he captured,
after all?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You forget,” Dorothea answered patiently,
“that we haven’t heard of him since his mother died,
long ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hal considered this for a moment, turning his
bandaged head restlessly from side to side.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you know Lee brought me home,” he remarked
a moment later. “I’d have died if it hadn’t
been for him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This convinced Dorothea that Hal by no means
knew what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all right, Hal,” she said soothingly.
“Don’t bother about it.” She meant to calm him,
feeling that this babbling about Lee Hendon would
be most distressing to April and not wishing to summon
her if she could avoid it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But he brought me home,” Hal persisted. “I
don’t want any of the family to hear about it. April
least of all. She’s down on Lee, you know, and this
would make it all the worse. Can’t you tell me what
has happened to him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hal, dear,” Dorothea said firmly, thinking that
he must be quieted, “you mustn’t talk, must you?
Please go to sleep and don’t bother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This seemed to have the reverse of a soothing
effect on the patient.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe he’s captured,” Hal cried, excitedly,
“and you’re all hiding it from me. And it will go
hard with him, too. I must see about it. How long
have I been here?” He started to raise himself
from the bed. “Send for Big Jim,” he ordered.
Dorothea was now half desperate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hal,” she insisted sternly, “listen to me and try
to understand what I tell you. Lee Hendon did not
bring you home. Your Big Jim brought you. He
told us so himself. He put you in a mule cart with
a lop-eared mule and drove you here. You just
dreamed it was Lee Hendon. And you will make
yourself ill if you go on like this. He isn’t captured,
that we know of, and besides the Yankees wouldn’t
harm him if he is. He’ll be safe enough till after the
war anyway. Don’t fret about him and go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The ghost of a smile appeared on Hal’s drawn
and haggard face. Then he lay down quietly, evidently
striving to gather strength against another
encounter with this stubborn girl beside him, so
that the next time he spoke Dorothea was impressed
that what he said was not the result of
delirium.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re a good sort, Dee,” he began, “and I
know I can trust you to keep a secret. Now please
don’t think I’m out of my head because I’m not now,
whatever I may have been. Listen, I owe Lee Hendon
my life. Do you understand that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Dorothea answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good,” replied Hal. “Lee saved my life and
brought me in here, no matter what that rascal Big
Jim had to say about it. He saw Big Jim and recognized
him, knowing that he was my body-servant.
Well, it was Lee paid for the cart and saw to it that
I landed safely here. Big Jim couldn’t possibly have
managed it alone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you sure, Hal?” Dorothea asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Positive,” he replied firmly. “And he’s in a
tight place, so I must see that he gets out of it. If
he’s captured nothing can save him. He is in the
Coulter Woods this minute waiting for word from
me, and here I’ve been, lying on my back, doing nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You can’t do anything now, Hal,” Dorothea interrupted,
seeing the certain drift of his talk. “You
haven’t the strength.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But something must be done for him,” Hal insisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well, I’ll help him,” Dorothea answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked up at her a moment, his eyes growing
moist.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think you’re the only one who would, Dee,”
he replied, lapsing into weakness again when he felt
the responsibility lifted from his shoulders. “If
you will pay my debt to him, I shall be easier in my
mind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, Hal,” she assured him. “You can
count on me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He nodded his head slightly and then with a
sigh dropped off to sleep, utterly exhausted.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was easy enough for Hal to say, “Pay my debt,”
but Dorothea had no idea how that was to be accomplished.
All she knew was that Lee Hendon
was in Coulter Woods or at least that Hal thought
so. As she speculated upon the matter she concluded
that Lee and Hal had parted on the understanding
that the former would remain there to receive the
help he was in need of. But it was in no wise clear
to Dorothea. Why should Hendon need help? In
what danger did he stand? Washington was his
home, and although he was not particularly popular
with the more fanatical people of the town, there
were many who understood something of his position
and were entirely sympathetic with him. The more
she pondered the matter the more she began again to
believe that Hal was not quite himself, and that his
illness and fever had been the cause of his curious
state of mind in regard to Lee Hendon.</p>

<p class='c012'>She sat beside the bed, gently fanning the tranquil
patient when Harriot came in on tiptoe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How is he?” she asked in a whisper, settling herself
on the floor beside Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s better, I think,” Dorothea whispered in
answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What he needs,” Harriot remarked judicially,
“is food. I’d be as weak as a kitten on the mushy
stuff they feed him. I wish his mammy was here.
She lives down on our plantation at Magnolia. She
understands about sick people. She always gives you
good things to eat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>April came in shortly and relieved Dorothea, but
Harriot had plans for the afternoon and spoke of
them as soon as they came out of the sick room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say, Dee,” she said, “let’s go over and see
Corinne. I think it would be fun to drive over ourselves
and—and Corinne was in, asking after Hal,
and she says their cook has just made some rice-flour
cookies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea hailed the suggestion promptly. She
thought she saw a way of getting to Coulter Woods
with no one the wiser, if it was important that the
rest of the family should not know that Lee Hendon
was lurking there. She did not understand why this
should be so, but Hal’s evident concern pointed to
that conclusion. There was, of course, the possibility
that Hal had been half delirious, but she dared
not take that for granted. She must go to the woods
alone and see if she could And Lee Hendon. So she
acquiesced in Harriot’s plans, and the two were
shortly on the road for the Stewart house.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Stewart, as usual, was busy packing. Piles
of clothing, shoes, curtains, blankets, baskets of silver,
packages of groceries, a confusion of all sorts of
things blocked the doorway; but Mrs. Stewart
greeted them as calmly as if she were in her reception
room receiving the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I sent for you to come up, my dears,” she explained,
“because I thought it would be a most valuable
lesson to see how a person with real foresight
and executive ability arranges for all the eventualities
of travel.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With elaborate care she took a huge muff from its
cedar box, examined it for moths and put it into one
of the open trunks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is my Brazilian trunk,” she remarked. “I
am taking my furs there, because I am sure they will
be quite unusual in Brazil, and a newcomer, you
know, must make an impression at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you’ve decided to go to Brazil, Aunt Cora,”
Harriot said. “I wonder what kind of things they
have to eat in Brazil,” she added dreamily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t really know,” her aunt replied quite seriously,
“but I am quite sure they must be delicious, or
we would have heard of it. Haven’t you often noticed
how people like to tell you about the awful
things they have to put up with on their travels? I
have, and yet never have I heard a complaint about
Brazil; so I have concluded it must be a most ideal
spot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea chuckled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that’s so,” she said; “People are always
telling you about the garlic in Italy and the smelly
cheese in Norway, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the rats in China,” Harriot put in, not to be
outdone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly,” Mrs. Stewart responded; “so, in my
Mexican trunks, I am putting a few simple necessities
in the food line.” She selected some packages
of groceries and settled them in another of the
trunks. “Of course you know I can’t live on the
beans and peppery things that Mexicans eat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you aren’t going to <i>both</i> Mexico and Brazil?”
Dorothea asked, her eyes opening in surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course not,” Mrs. Stewart replied with considerable
pride. “That’s where my foresight comes
in. I don’t know which place I may finally decide to
select, so I am packing for <i>both</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this announcement the girls exchanged amused
glances, but Mrs. Stewart was diving into another
trunk and did not see.</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot stayed long enough to secure the refreshments
that sooner or later were always forthcoming,
and then she suddenly discovered a good reason why
they should be getting home again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you really going this time, Aunt Cora?”
Harriot asked as they were taking their departure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Almost any day now, my love,” her aunt answered,
“but I sha’n’t go without seeing you-all once
more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wasn’t thinking of that,” Harriot answered
frankly, though without the slightest intention of
being rude. “I was just wondering who would get
the peaches. You know, Dee,” she went on, turning
to Dorothea, “the Crosslands peaches are the best
in the state.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear child,” Aunt Cora replied with gracious
generosity, “you may have as many as you like when
we are gone. Only I am afraid that the Yankees
will take them all before you can get a chance at
them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Huh!” grunted Harriot, bristling. “If those
peaches are <i>mine</i>, it’ll take a mighty smart Yankee
to get them away from me. And besides, I can eat
them greener than any upstart Northerner that ever
was born. I’ve had practice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They’re yours, honey, if we are away,” her aunt
replied with a laugh. “Only don’t make yourself
sick.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing ever makes me sick,” Harriot replied
proudly. “The more I eat the weller and weller I
get.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know,” sighed her aunt. “I’d give my small
emerald ring for such a digestion as you have, Harriot.
By the way, there’s a raspberry tart somewhere.
You might just as well eat it up. It disagreed
with me horribly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have!” Harriot replied with a triumphant
grin, and they went down stairs after saying good-by.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As sure as you’re born, Dee,” Harriot said as
they started to get into the carriage, “Aunt Cora
won’t go away now any more than she did the other
times she started.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t believe she will, either,” Dorothea
agreed absently, for her mind was upon the matter
that had brought her there so willingly. She wanted
to go through the Coulter Woods alone and she was
now alert to seize the first opportunity that offered
to try her plan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot, driving the old horse, chattered on, seemingly
unmindful of Dorothea’s indifferent answers,
and presently they neared the place where the path
entered the woods.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My, but this is a slow horse,” Dorothea suddenly
remarked out of a clear sky; which was doing
the animal something of an injustice, and Harriot
immediately rushed to its defense, as Dorothea
hoped she would.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s not so slow at all,” Harriot contradicted
promptly. “Mose isn’t very young any more, but
he’s not so slow either.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I could walk home quicker than we’ll get there
this way,” Dorothea answered with exaggerated
scorn.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You could not,” Harriot answered. “You
couldn’t possibly, even if you ran through the
woods.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, pshaw,” remarked Dorothea. “I could
crawl through the woods and beat you home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll bet you our dessert for supper you can’t!”
Harriot challenged promptly and pulled up the horse
at the path.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right,” cried Dorothea, jumping down into
the road. “We’ll see who eats two desserts,” and
with a wave of her hand she plunged out of sight
while Harriot chirped old Mose into a good trot.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once safe from observation Dorothea slowed her
walk to a saunter. Before she had attained her
object she had pictured Lee Hendon as popping out
from behind every bush; but now that she was actually
among the trees she realized that if he was in
hiding he would scarcely wish to be seen by a stranger
wandering that way. Yet, if he was there, she must
find him, for she did not know when another such
chance would present itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>She dared not call his name. It was possible, of
course, that, save for him, she was the only person
within miles; but she could not be certain of this.
And how could she show him that she was a person
to be trusted? That seemed a difficult thing to
accomplish.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, of a sudden, she remembered her coming
to the South under a flag of truce, honored alike by
the Confederacy and the Union. She would show a
white flag and if Lee Hendon saw her he would at
least know that she was not an enemy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her handkerchief, she decided, was too small, but
she had a large white veil and this she tied to the
handle of her parasol. Then she talked slowly on,
waving her improvised flag in the air.</p>

<p class='c012'>But for a time she saw nothing of the man she
sought. Now and then she would halt and look
about her; but everything was silent and still, and,
though she could imagine that the bushes hid all sorts
of wild creatures, there was no movement to show of
their existence.</p>

<p class='c012'>She set off again, a little discouraged, but after a
moment or two a sharp cracking of a twig off to her
right, brought her to a stop. Again she looked back,
peering into the closely growing underbrush and
straining her ears, but there was no further sound
and once more she walked slowly on.</p>

<p class='c012'>For several minutes she continued on her way,
when a low whistle halted her in her tracks. She
was certain now that she was followed. She had
felt it vaguely before, and the cracking of the twig
had confirmed this sensation. Now the whistle was
sure evidence, and she stood still and waited.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a moment or two she heard the rustling sound
of something moving through the bushes toward her,
but could see nothing until a voice addressed her out
of the thicket ten yards or so away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you looking for any one in particular?”
came the low-toned inquiry.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” she answered, boldly, but her heart was
beating a little faster than was its wont.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who sent you?” was the next challenge.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hal May,” she returned. The bushes parted
and the man whose face she had seen at the window
the night of her first party at the Mays’ stood before
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>But at the sight of him she drew back with a little
cry of surprise and fear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re not Lee Hendon?” she faltered. “You
can’t be!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course I am,” he replied gravely, and then
Dorothea understood something in Hal’s talk that
had puzzled her, for Lee Hendon was dressed in the
uniform of a Union officer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

    <div>IN COULTER WOODS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The first thought that came into Dorothea’s
mind when she saw Lee Hendon in the uniform
of a Northern officer was concerned
with April.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does she know?” the girl questioned herself,
and found no ready answer. The suspicion had held
in her mind that April was in communication with
Lee Hendon; but it was not a suspicion likely to be
shared by Hal, who, it was plain enough, had confided
his mission to her, because, so far as he was
aware, there was no other in the household who
would have undertaken it.</p>

<p class='c012'>This passed through her mind in a flash, for the
young man before her seemed ill at ease and glanced
about him apprehensively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are very good to have come,” he said most
politely. “I do not know who you are; but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am Mrs. May’s niece,” Dorothea interrupted.
“My name is Dorothea Drummond and my home
was in England.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I see,” Hendon replied comprehendingly.
“I am most anxious to know how Hal is coming on.
He was in a rather desperate condition when I last
saw him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To-day is really the first time he has had his
senses,” Dorothea answered. “That is the reason
there was no word from him sooner. He spoke to
me of you this morning and I am here to find out how
I can help you to get away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What I want principally,” Hendon responded
quickly, “is a Confederate uniform.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Now for the second time within a few days Dorothea
was asked to play what she felt to be a treacherous
part to those whose hospitality she was enjoying.
She knew in her heart that her sympathy for the
Northern cause was growing and realized she would
be glad to see the war end in favor of the Union.
Yet here was a Federal officer asking for aid, which
she had no more right to give than she had had in
the case of Larry Stanchfield. All she could do was
what she thought Hal might contrive were he here
in her stead. Indeed, as far as a uniform was concerned,
the granting of Lee Hendon’s request was
beyond her power.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must know that is impossible,” she replied.
“Confederate uniforms are hard to obtain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course that’s true,” he granted. “I was
only hoping Hal might have an extra one. These
clothes are a bit awkward.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” she nodded, realizing that here lay his
reason for hiding even from his former friends in
the little town.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you can bring me some money,” he said,
finally, after a moment of deep thought, “I shall be
able to manage. All that I had and all that Hal
had was spent in getting him home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I brought some gold with me, thinking that was
what you might need,” Dorothea replied, and held
out to him a netted silk purse heavy with coins.</p>

<p class='c012'>He took it mechanically, but shook his head and
smiled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was most thoughtful of you, but it wouldn’t be
of the least use to me, you know. Where I am going,
I couldn’t find a soul to change a ten-dollar
gold piece. Haven’t you any paper money?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sorry,” Dorothea replied, genuinely grieved
at her lack of foresight. “It was stupid of me,
wasn’t it, not to have realized that difficulty? I
thought gold would be just the thing you would
want.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Under ordinary conditions you would have been
quite right,” Hendon hastened to assure her. “You
have not the slightest reason to accuse yourself of
thoughtlessness, and I must seem like a most ungrateful
brute; but you see my life really depends upon it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can get you paper for it right away,” Dorothea
suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That will be good of you,” he answered.
“How soon do you think you can have it for me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can go into the village to-morrow morning,”
Dorothea replied, and then hesitated. “But I can’t
tell when I will be able to get off alone again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I dare not loiter about in these woods,” he
told her. “It’s running too great a risk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then where can I meet you?” Dorothea asked.
“Where are you living?” she added.</p>

<p class='c012'>“With some turpentine gatherers,” he replied.
“They have a hut deep in the woods, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Couldn’t I go there with the money?” Dorothea
broke in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You would never find the place,” Lee said, with
a shake of his head. “It would be easier for you
to come back here, but I shall want to know exactly
when to expect you. Which is your room in the
May house?” he ended.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The one at the southwest corner,” she replied
after an instant’s effort to fix the points of the compass.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good,” he replied. “That is the first bit of
luck we’ve had so far. I can see that room from a
place I know in the woods. When you’re sure you’ll
have a chance to get here alone, pull the curtain
down all the way. If it is at night and you plan to
reach me the next morning, a lighted candle will tell
me. I haven’t much else to do, so I’ll be watching
most of the time,” he added with a pathetic smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well,” Dorothea agreed and prepared to
start on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t bring all that money in bills,” he cautioned
her. “Five hundred dollars in State notes
and two thousand, say, in Confederate money will
be ample.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That hardly seems enough,” she replied, remembering
Lucy’s saying that it took a barrelful of Confederate
money to pay for the bung-hole.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It will be plenty,” he assured her. “Good-by,
and thank you very, very much for coming to my
aid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He held out his hand and Dorothea took it, but at
that moment there came the sounds of footsteps on
the path beyond them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go quickly, it’s Harriot looking for me,” she
whispered, and Lee Hendon plunged into the thicket.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea turned, expecting to see her young cousin
ready with a bantering remark at her slowness, but
to her great astonishment April came toward her,
walking at a rather rapid pace. An instant later the
two girls stopped short and stared at each other.</p>

<p class='c012'>To Dorothea there was but one explanation of
this sudden appearance of April’s. She must have
heard that Lee Hendon was hiding in the neighborhood.
She wondered what excuse her beautiful
cousin would make.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t expect to see you here,” April remarked.
“I thought you were driving with Harry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have a wager on whether the horse can beat
me home,” Dorothea answered, but at the moment
she said it there came a crash in the bushes as if
some one had fallen, in tripping over a log.</p>

<p class='c012'>April’s keen glance went to Dorothea’s face and
read there something of the confusion the younger
girl felt. They stood in silence, awaiting a repetition
of the strange noise, but there was no further
sound.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was a rather curious commotion for these
woods,” April said significantly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are there deer about here?” Dorothea asked,
quite calm now and returning her cousin’s look
quietly. “Or bears? I didn’t know there were any
large animals in this part of the country. But how
comes it, April, that you are not with Hal?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mother is there,” the girl answered. “She is
better and wished me to get out into the air for a
little while. I want something from Aunt Cora, and
was on my way there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea nodded as if she understood. She did
not dare to speak for fear of betraying the skepticism
she felt at this explanation of April’s presence in the
woods.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must hurry on,” she said, taking a step forward,
“or Harriot will be coming to find me. Hope
you have a nice walk.” And off she ran, leaving
her cousin gazing after her for a moment or two.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was a blue uniform I saw, after all!” April
said to herself as she walked on again.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As Dorothea had expected, she found Harriot
waiting for her and forestalled any questions
by setting her cousin’s thoughts upon the two
portions of dessert that were in store for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You win!” she cried as soon as she was within
speaking distance. “I only hope you don’t make
yourself sick eating too many sweet things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Huh!” Harriot expostulated, forgetting how
long she had been waiting for Dorothea and her
speculations upon the cause of the delay. “Somebody
is always telling me that, and it doesn’t do the
slightest good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They argued the matter at length, and Dorothea
thus avoided an explanation she was by no means
ready to give.</p>

<p class='c012'>But it was with some difficulty that she kept her
thoughts upon the conversation she herself had
started, for her mind dwelt constantly on the problems
she had yet to meet. It would not be any too
easy for her to go back to Lee Hendon unobserved,
and she felt that there was great need of his getting
away as soon as possible. April’s sudden appearance
on the scene seemed to indicate a knowledge of
her lover’s presence there. Dorothea was not inclined
to accept the fact that her cousin’s arrival was
purely accidental and was of the opinion that the two
she had left might even now be talking to each other,
yet in that case assistance from her seemed superfluous.
Altogether it remained a puzzle.</p>

<p class='c012'>When they reached the house Merry was there to
meet them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please, Miss Dee,” said the girl, “Marse Hal,
he’s a grievin’ foh yoh, and Ol’ Miss she says will
yoh jes’ look in on him a minute and see if yoh can
quieten him down lak? She’s dressin’ and wants
Lil’ Marse to go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea went directly to Hal’s room and knocked
at the door. Big Jim opened it with a finger on his
lips to enjoin silence; but, seeing who it was, he
stepped aside, and she went in quickly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad to see you, Dorothea,” Hal said in a
whisper; but in his searching eyes she read the question
he was so anxious to have answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>She leaned over the bed with a word of greeting,
patting and adjusting the pillows under his head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all right,” she whispered. “I’ve seen Lee.
I expect to give him some money to-morrow. Then
he can get away in a hurry, can’t he?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hal nodded his head and a smile came over his
drawn face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good girl,” he murmured. “Now I can go to
sleep,” and without another word he turned over on
his side and fell into a quiet doze almost as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c012'>And Dorothea at last understood why Hal had
been so much troubled over this matter. To be in
debt to an enemy is a burden hard to bear, and the
young man could not rest content until that debt had
been discharged. But Dorothea knew also that Lee
Hendon deserved more credit than he was ever likely
to get from those for whom he had risked his life.
The blue uniform he wore added enormously to the
danger he had run to save the life of April’s brother.
Yet he had taken the risk, spent his scanty supply of
money, put his life in jeopardy for the friend of his
youth, and all for the sake of the girl he loved.
Dorothea was convinced that Lee Hendon was a
brave man, and the more she thought of what he
had done the more she found to admire in him. No
doubt he would be called a traitor to his country.
No doubt the fact that he had not volunteered to
fight for the South when the war broke out would
be but added evidence of his disloyalty. It would be
said that he only awaited a favorable opportunity to
turn his back upon the land that had given him birth,
and that his mother’s illness was made his excuse.
They might go further and say that he had remained
in the South as long as he could in order to furnish
information to the Yankees, for whom he had renounced
his country and his kin. All this might be
said with some show of evidence to back it, and
Dorothea did not disguise from herself that the part
of spy and traitor was not one to be admired, no
matter how one’s sympathies were drawn. Yet, with
all these things in her mind, she could not help a
growing admiration for the young man.</p>

<p class='c012'>And what of April? Granting that she knew of
his presence, did she know what Lee Hendon was
doing? And if so, what excuse could she give for
her complicity? The puzzle grew constantly more
and more complex. Dorothea failed to make head
or tail out of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all so mixed up,” she said to herself, “that
I wouldn’t be surprised to be told I’m the only Red
String there is, after all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Later in the day she went down stairs, and seated
herself on the porch, waiting for Miss Imogene,
whose return was expected, and planning how to find
an opportunity to secure the money to take to Coulter
Woods. She would not rest easy until she had
done her part to enable Lee Hendon to rejoin his
friends in the North.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then her thoughts went to Larry Stanchfield. She
had scarcely had time to think of him at all, and now
she wondered how he fared and speculated upon the
motives that had made Val Tracy take such an important
part in the young man’s previous escape.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will be glad to have Cousin Imogene back,”
she said to herself, as the carriage rolled up the drive
and drew up to let the dainty little lady she was
thinking of descend in state, spreading her furbelows
magnificently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was just this minute wishing you were here!”
Dorothea exclaimed, throwing her arms about Miss
Imogene. It was unusual, for the English bred girl
was not given to such demonstrations of affection,
and the older woman was a little surprised.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe you are glad to see me,” she said, as
she kissed Dorothea. “It is just like an American
welcome you gave me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I’m half American,” Dorothea answered
with an embarrassed little laugh. She realized that
in giving way to this impulse she was running counter
to her training; but, curiously enough, she didn’t
care. “Sometimes I’m sorry I’m not all American.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will be, in time,” Miss Imogene replied
lightly, taking a chair beside the one Dorothea had
been occupying. “Sit down, dear, and tell me your
news.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How did you know I had any news?” demanded
Dorothea, her eyes widening with surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I guessed,” Miss Imogene answered, “and now
I know. Come, out with it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have seen Mr. Stanchfield again,” the girl whispered,
after looking about her to make sure she was
not overheard. “He was disguised as a wounded
Confederate soldier.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no doubt Miss Imogene was interested.
She leaned close to Dorothea and urged her to tell
all she knew, listening with scarcely an interruption
till the tale was finished.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so Val Tracy helped him away,” Miss Ivory
murmured at the end, more than half to herself.
“I wonder what is behind that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think I know,” Dorothea said, in a low voice.
“Val is a Red String.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Miss Imogene turned to the girl beside her with
a quick motion, as if she was surprised.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never thought of that. What makes you say
so?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There isn’t any other way to explain it,” Dorothea
replied. “He must be something like that,
otherwise—”</p>

<p class='c012'>She broke off, and for a moment or two they both
sat thinking over the situation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is of course an explanation,” Miss Imogene
commented, “but I don’t know whether it is a reasonable
one or not. I don’t know.” She repeated
the words several times, evidently puzzled. “After
all the main thing is that the boy escaped. But now
he’s come back and is in a worse position than he was
then. He’ll be shot if he’s caught this time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He didn’t seem at all afraid of that,” Dorothea
explained. “He was only impatient to be on his
way to warn the Union men. I couldn’t help in that,
of course; but I confess, Cousin Imogene, I hope he
succeeds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re more of a Yankee than you were when I
left,” Miss Imogene returned with something of a
smile. “But you mustn’t talk to me about it. Nor
to any one else,” she added. “They don’t want
Yankee sympathizers in this country, nor yet in this
house, honey, so you must be careful what you say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” Dorothea answered. “And it isn’t
that I want the South to be beaten exactly. Only, I
do want this war to end—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you are such an imaginative person, Dorothea,”
Miss Imogene cut in sharply. Out of the
corner of her eye she saw the figure of April coming
up to the open window behind them. “And you
haven’t asked me anything about my trip. My dear,
it was dreadful. The roads are lakes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that you, Cousin Imogene?” cried April
through the window, and then Dorothea understood
why the conversation had been changed so abruptly.</p>

<p class='c012'>April’s welcome of Miss Imogene was obviously
sincere, but very shortly she made an excuse to leave
them, and the two were alone again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder why April doesn’t like me?” Dorothea
speculated half-musingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but she does,” Miss Imogene remarked with
a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, she doesn’t,” Dorothea insisted with a
laugh. “If you just watch—you’ll see. You
won’t notice anything at first, but in a little while
you’ll find out she simply can’t bear me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The elder woman pondered this statement for a
moment. Then she shook her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If April had cared a rap for Val Tracy—but
she never did,” Miss Imogene said, half to herself.
“No, no, child! You’re just imagining things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sure I’m right, Cousin Imogene,” Dorothea
maintained, firm in her opinion of the matter.
“And besides, I don’t see what Val Tracy has to do
with it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Speak of angels and you’ll hear the rustle of
their wings,” cried a voice behind them and Captain
Tracy himself stepped upon the gallery floor, having
come across the thick grass of the lawn so noiselessly
that they had not heard his approach.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listeners never hear any good of themselves,
you mean,” Miss Imogene laughed, giving him her
hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith, that’s why I didn’t listen,” he responded
promptly, as he bowed over the dainty fingers.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea’s welcome was more cordial than she
was aware and as the tall young Irishman looked
down into her eyes he could have little doubt that
she was glad to see him. The girl herself would
have given a good deal to know what was going on
behind his humorous, twinkling eyes, and began to
realize, now that he was back, that she had missed
him more than she had thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what has brought you out of the clouds
after all this time?” demanded Miss Imogene a
little later.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The same old thing,” he replied with a reckless
laugh. “Horses! They’re mighty useful, you
know, when it comes to fighting and we’re going
to have our fill of that or I’m an Orangeman!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At his words April popped her head out of the
window.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is this our brave Captain Tracy come to
threaten us,” she laughed gayly.</p>

<p class='c012'>She stood inside holding out her hand to the
young man, who took it eagerly. “I’m mighty glad
to see you,” she went on, her tones warm and
friendly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I’m glad to be back even for a little while,”
he answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is the news from Richmond?” April asked
a moment later.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tracy shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not the best, if what I hear is true,” he answered,
the smile fading from his lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have rumors, too, by grapevine telegraph,”
April responded, referring to a name given to the
mysterious means of communication that seemed to
exist among the negroes and the poorer classes of
whites. “But I’m not afraid that ‘Marse Robert’
will be beaten. He’s more than a match for your
old Grant!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s not my Grant,” Tracy protested. “But,
whatever happens, there’s some grand fighting ahead
of us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, Val Tracy,” cried Harriot, as she burst
upon the scene. “Where did you come from? I
thought you’d given us up for good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bad pennies are not so easily gotten rid of,”
he laughed, and taking one of her hands he bent
down as if to kiss it, but instead took a generous
bite of the cake it held. “Faith, ’tis good I’m
here to help save a noble digestion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Huh!” grunted Harriot, “a little bit of cake
like that wouldn’t hurt me. I could eat three times
that much—if I could get it. But Aunt Decent
says we’re poor now and I’ll have to stop hooking
cake. You can have this,” she went on, holding out
the piece Tracy had bitten, “and if you’ll hold my
other slice I’ll go back and get more. I reckon
Aunt Decent isn’t expecting me just now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Shortly after this Mrs. May came out to welcome
the new Captain and to congratulate him upon his
promotion. And the conversation became centered
upon matters of general utility. Val, although uncertain,
thought he might stay for perhaps a day or
two and the women immediately began planning for
the patching of his clothes and shirts. They were
all glad to see him. He brought them news of the
outside world, gossip of the camps, messages from
friends and relatives, and in a little while they were
all sitting about him, busy with their needles while
he talked of the things nearest all their hearts and
answered the many questions they put to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Presently, in the midst of their talk, Aunt Dilsey’s
Sam came shuffling around the corner of the house
and stopped before them. He took off his hat and
drew nearer, waiting till Mrs. May should recognize
his presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is there something you want, Sam?” she asked,
in a pause in the conversation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Ol’ Miss,” he said, hesitatingly. “I’ve
been thinkin’ a mighty lot lately since you-all has
bought we-all, and, please’m, I’d be ’bliged if you-all
would sell me to that Macon man, jes’ as quick as
eveh you can.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sell you, Sam?” exclaimed Mrs. May in great
surprise. “Sell you—and keep Aunt Dilsey?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes’m, that’s what I’m thinkin’,” the boy replied,
and there was in his manner a not quite understandable
hint of suppressed excitement. “You
see, Ol’ Miss, that Macon man he ain’t got no manneh
of use for my gran’mam nohow; but he’s mighty
ready to give a good price fo’ Sam. Please, Ol’
Miss, sell me, and sell me quick.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The request was a strange one, and Mrs. May,
used to dealing with these simple people, expressed
no further surprise at it, but sought the reasons behind
it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why have you decided that you want to be
sold?” she asked kindly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It ain’t that I’s ’zackly <i>wantin’</i>, Ol’ Miss,” the
boy replied, his eagerness growing with his decreasing
embarrassment. “That Macon man, he’s
meaner ’an dirt and that’s why I wants you to sell
me to him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked up with a broad grin on his face, seeming
to think he had made himself perfectly plain
and that somewhere hidden in his words was a huge
joke upon some one.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You want to be sold to a mean man?” Mrs.
May repeated. “I don’t understand you, Sam.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Ol’ Miss, it’s like this,” the boy began,
trying to make his explanation clear. “These
Yanks is a-coming. Yes’m, we-all ain’t got no doubt
o’ that, and so I’s figgerin’ I’d be free, anyways,
and I’d a heap ruther that Macon man should lose
me than my Ol’ Miss, when she was so kind and
bought me an’ my ol’ gran’mam. But there ain’t
much time to waste, Ol’ Miss. You heah what I’s
tellin’ yoh.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why are you so sure the Yanks are coming,
Sam?” April asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, Lil’ Miss, I jes’ nachally knows it,” he
answered. “We-all down in the quarters is a-talkin’
hit oveh, and there ain’t no doubt ’bout it. Why,
Lil’ Miss, don’ you-all know that this heah Yankee
General has beat Marse Robert Lee?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who told you that?” demanded Val Tracy,
suddenly turning on the boy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nobody don’t tol’ us, Cap’n Tracy, we jes’
knows it, that’s all.” The boy looked up with a
bland smile on his face that was wholly free from
the slightest trace of guile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The grapevine telegraph again,” Tracy murmured
under his breath, shaking his head in deep
perplexity.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. May dismissed Sam almost immediately,
saying a word of her appreciation, but
also insisting that his proposal was out of
the question.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whatever happens, Sam,” she told him, “your
home will be here. If you get your freedom, then
you can stay or go as you like; but we shall always
be glad to have our people stay. Now go back to
your work and say no more about being sold.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The moment the boy was gone April turned to
Tracy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Val,” she demanded, her face white and drawn,
“can it be possible that Lee has surrendered?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he answered reluctantly. “It is possible.
We had word of a battle at Five Forks and, if we’ve
lost it, I don’t see what else General Lee could do.
I’m afraid Sam’s news is true, but we shall know
for certain very shortly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then the war will soon be ended,” Mrs. May
said prayerfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>April raised her head as if to speak, her eyes
flashing angrily; but her white lips trembled and of
a sudden she left them.</p>

<p class='c012'>With the arrival of the train to Washington all
doubt of the events that had taken place at Richmond
were put at rest. Lee had surrendered and
Jefferson Davis was in flight. The Confederacy
was breaking fast.</p>

<p class='c012'>After supper that night Dorothea, looking out of
her window, saw April and Val Tracy walking together
on the lawn, deep in earnest conversation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is little wonder he is in love with her,” she
thought, and turned away with just the faintest of
sighs. Possibly she did not know that she sighed.</p>

<p class='c012'>But in thinking that their conversation had anything
to do with love, Dorothea was very much mistaken.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The grapevine telegraph doesn’t carry all the
news,” Val was saying to April in a half whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean by that?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It isn’t all over yet,” he went on, glancing about
to make sure he was not overheard. “We have a
shot left in our locker that may surprise the Yanks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell me, Val,” she demanded eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s an expedition planned against the Union
forces at Savannah,” he went on in an undertone.
“But it’s very secret and there are only a few of
us who know it. If it is successful it may have a
greater influence than you would believe. The
North is tired of the war and the South will be discouraged
over this bad news of Lee. But if we
capture Savannah again we shall find the Confederacy
ready to fight on and the Union ready to come
to some compromise. If not, we shall organize in
Texas and continue the war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But can you get the men, Val?” April asked,
the color coming back into her face. “Oh, it would
be glorious if we could strike another blow. And it
might make all the difference. Can you do it, do
you think?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We can, if the secret is kept,” he replied gravely.
“With the Yankees unprepared we can beat them.
We are gathering men from all over the State. Volunteers,
and what troops we can find, and we are
sending them to a rendezvous. But all must be done
sub rosa. Even our officers are not aware of what’s
afoot. The Yanks must be taken by surprise, and
if they are, the city will be ours. So you see the
importance of letting as few know of it as possible.
If we succeed in surprising them we’ll drive every
Yankee out of the State.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll do it, Val, I feel sure of it,” April whispered
enthusiastically. “No one will betray you
and it will put new heart into the South.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly!” Val replied. “It’s a fine plan. We
know what the Yankees are doing and they don’t
know anything of our movements. They think.
Georgia hasn’t any soldiers, but they’ll find out differently.
But be careful, April. Don’t breathe a
word of it even in your sleep. Faith, I suppose I
shouldn’t have told you, but you were so upset over
this bad news I just couldn’t help giving you something
to hope for. I trust we shall succeed. In
fact I know we shall, if the secret is kept.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, Val,” April said, dropping her voice, “be
careful what you say around here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, there’s nobody in the family who would
betray us,” he answered lightly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be too sure of that,” she returned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whom do you mean, April?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am not sure, but—” She hesitated. “No,
I don’t want to do any one an injustice. I may be
mistaken, but I am on the watch. Under any circumstances
don’t breathe a word of your plans to
another living soul. Promise, Val.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith, I promise with all my heart,” he answered.
“I hadn’t any intention of even telling
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How long will you be here?” she asked a moment
later.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Till I get orders to move,” he replied. “A day
or so at most. In the meantime I shall be out, looking
for horses and getting together any men that I
can find.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea noticed that April’s eyes were sparkling
as they had not sparkled for a long time when she
came into the room after her stroll upon the lawn
with Val Tracy. And this brought another thought
to plague the girl. Could it be that April was fond
of Val? That, in spite of all she had heard, it was
this young Irishman her cousin really cared for and
not Lee Hendon?</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can easily understand how she might,” she
said to herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nor was Dorothea the only one in the room to
notice the difference in April’s spirits and to find a
possible cause for it. Miss Imogene, her bright
eyes taking in all that went on about her, watched
the girl for a moment and then shook her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It would be too bad,” she thought enigmatically.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Dorothea April had in mind when she
warned Tracy that there might be one in the family
who would betray his secret. Her conviction of the
rightfulness of the Confederate cause made it impossible,
at times, for her not to be swayed by her
prejudices. Almost from the day of Dorothea’s
arrival she had harbored a suspicion of her cousin’s
purpose in visiting them. From the moment she
earned that a band of Northern sympathizers were
actually at work in the South she could not forget
that Dorothea wore a red band of velvet around her
wrist. She was never without it, and once having
seized upon the idea, April was constantly on the
lookout for some other evidence that would connect
her cousin directly with the “Red Strings.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was nothing in the girl’s actions to confirm
these suspicions save the wearing of that red band
about her wrist. The fact that a prisoner escaped
from Andersonville had passed their way was no
matter for surprise. Such escapes were frequent,
and no particular importance could be attached to
that event. In addition she had a genuine liking
for Dorothea. In the year that had passed since
her cousin had come to visit them there were times
when she had entirely forgotten the doubt that
haunted her. It was so vague and so improbable
that she was rather ashamed of her lack of trust and
had been careful to tell no one of it. She appreciated
that Dorothea had not the same intense love
for the Confederate cause that she had, but she was
also too sensible a person to expect it. Indeed she
wanted to be fair, but her suspicion persisted and
the most careless act which held a shadow of suggestion
that could strengthen this belief her mind
fastened on tenaciously. And, as the fortunes of
the Confederacy became more and more desperate,
April, with nerves at tension, was ready to distort
any innocent action into some evidence of treachery.</p>

<p class='c012'>Early in the year something had happened to
again fasten her suspicions upon Dorothea. She did
not remember long what this had been, but every
day she had watched for confirmation of her growing
conviction. She was no longer able to conceal
what she felt and so took the precaution to avoid
being alone with her cousin lest she betray her feelings.
So certain had she become that she was right
that she determined to have absolute proof before
she made any accusations either to the girl herself
or to her mother. And so, day by day, she kept her
own council; but there was scarcely a time in her
waking hours that she was not entirely aware of
where Dorothea was and what she did.</p>

<div id='i002'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus-002.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>A flag of truce, honored alike by the Confederacy and the Union.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>And yet when the moment came for her to find
confirmation of her worst suspicions, she was
shocked. Her walk through the woods the day before
had been taken without thought of Dorothea
and she had come across her cousin quite unexpectedly.
But she had seen a man disappear into the
bushes and was sure that he wore a dark blue uniform.</p>

<p class='c012'>April’s first impulse had been to accuse the girl
then and there, but her sense of justice held her
back. Perhaps Dorothea would offer voluntary explanation,
though she did not think this a possibility.
Once having resisted the natural impulse to speak
out, she had time to consider the situation more
calmly, and concluded that she would lose nothing
by waiting, and perhaps might gain much. If the
man she had seen was a Union spy, and she began
firmly to believe that he was, to capture him would
be a service for the cause and a complete case against
Dorothea. Moreover, in order to do this, she must
not let her cousin have the faintest idea that she
was suspected. She argued that her arrival upon
the scene in the woods had interrupted an interview
that in all likelihood would be renewed at the first
opportunity, and April meant to be there and catch
them red-handed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next morning, therefore, when she saw her cousin
leave the house dressed for a walk, April seized a
hat to follow, thinking at first that the trail would
lead to Coulter Woods. It was obvious at once that
Dorothea had no intention of going in that direction
but was bending her steps to the village, and she
changed her plans. Plainly Dorothea had no intention
then of meeting the Federal soldier; but
April felt that her cousin’s errand was of importance
and that she must know what it was.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the streets of so small a village it would be
wellnigh impossible to spy upon her undetected.
She was especially anxious now that Dorothea should
not have the slightest inkling of the fact that she
was being observed, and to meet April in town, on
foot, would be unusual enough to cause comment.
Some thought of sending her maid, Merry, occurred
to April, but she shook her head, feeling that it was
impossible to have a servant spy upon her cousin.
Whatever was to be done she must do herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turning into the house she ran upstairs, picking
up, as she went, a pair of battered field-glasses that
hung on the wall near the hall-stand. Then she
went directly to the garret and dropped to her knees
on the floor beside the moon-shaped window at one
end. The glass was gray with dust, but her handkerchief
was not the filmy bit of linen and lace it
would have been some years before and she did not
hesitate to use it upon one of the small panes. Next
she adjusted her glasses and looked into the principal
street of the town, where she could distinguish
clearly all who passed.</p>

<p class='c012'>This was no new game for April. As a child she
had often watched from this garret to see what was
going on, and she had no difficulty now in picking out
the various buildings. The Court House was the
most prominent, and she thought of the day when
Secession was declared and the “Bonny blue flag”
made by Miss Fanny Andrews had been raised over
it. She commanded a full view of the business portion
of the town, but she had time to wonder if Judge
Andrews, sturdily loyal to the Union, had ever
learned of his daughter’s part in the wild enthusiasm
that had gone on while he sat behind darkened windows,
before Dorothea walked across the square,
putting a stop to all such memories.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She may be going to call upon Mrs. Robertson,”
April thought, and then, a moment later, “Oh, how
stupid of me. Of course he would need money!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She had seen her cousin walk purposefully into the
bank, and her conclusions were natural. There was
no further need to spy just then. It would be Dorothea’s
next adventure that would be important.
April put her glasses in their case and, slipping downstairs,
hung them in their place. Thereafter she
kept out of sight, feeling certain that Dorothea
would do nothing more until after dinner.</p>

<p class='c012'>Later that morning she went into the parlor upon
some errand, and the sound of low-pitched voices
coming from the porch, reached her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“—and if this expedition against Savannah—” Dorothea
was saying when Miss Imogene had interrupted
her, with a decided “Hush!”</p>

<p class='c012'>For April the words held a world of significance,
and instinctively she turned and tiptoed away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Evidently her cousin knew all about the expedition
to capture Savannah, and was doing her best to
thwart the efforts of the Southern leaders. That
was why she was in communication with a Union spy.
He was to warn the Federal forces that they were to
be attacked. She was preparing to furnish him
money and information, using her relationship with
them and taking advantage of their hospitality to
betray their cause. In her heart April’s anger grew
hot at the thought. There was no longer any doubt
in her mind about Dorothea’s treachery. She would
have denounced her cousin then and there, but now
she appreciated that more than this was involved.
It had been something of a personal affair heretofore.
She had only had a desire to prove her cousin
a Northern sympathizer. Now, however, the situation
assumed a more serious aspect. If the spy
escaped to tell the plans of the attack on Savannah,
all the hopes in which she had indulged would be
shattered. Therefore she must step carefully and
conceal her anger against Dorothea for the sake of
capturing the spy. That was the most important
object for the time being. What should be done
about her cousin’s activities in the Northern interests
could come later.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how did she hear of it?” April suddenly
questioned herself. And an answer popped into her
head almost simultaneously. Val was the only one
who knew of it. Who else could have told her?
And moreover April, wise in the affairs of the
heart, guessed that the gay Irish Captain had been
more than a little attracted by this handsome English
girl who had come among them. Pretty speeches
he made to every one, but she had noted again and
again the thoughtful way in which his eyes followed
Dorothea whenever she was in sight. She remembered
that he spoke of her cousin, not in the exaggerated,
complimentary way that was his habit, but
gently, with words that seemed to come from a sincere
reeling. She had anticipated that one day there
might be a love affair between them, and she was not
one of the selfish beauties who resented any man’s
attention to another. She liked Val Tracy, as she
did twenty other young fellows who paid their court
to her, but she felt no spark of jealousy on Dorothea’s
account.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not unnatural then that she should jump
to the conclusion that Val, trusting the girl, had told
her what was afoot, and that Dorothea had been
quick to make use of it to warn the Yankees. Val
had returned from one of his expeditions but she had
no chance to speak to him until after dinner; then
she led him out on to the lawn where they could
talk in the certainty of not being overheard, but she
had seen Dorothea go up to her room and took pains
to make sure that she could not leave the house
unobserved.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now what good deed have I done that I should
be thus rewarded?” asked Tracy when he and April
were alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It isn’t a time for pretty speeches, Val,” she
answered. “The Yankees are going to be warned
of our plans to take Savannah!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked at her in amazement for a moment,
without speaking, as if he could not believe his ears.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s impossible, April,” he answered. “There
aren’t half a dozen people in the world know of it.
And two of them are right here. We haven’t even
told our officers. It’s impossible!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, it isn’t, Val,” she answered. “Some one
else knows. Some one right here. One of the family,
and we are about to be betrayed. It may already
be too late, but I hope not.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is it?” demanded Tracy shortly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorothea,” April answered, and looked keenly
at him, expecting to read in his face a confirmation
of her conclusion that he had told her cousin of the
plan.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Tracy showed nothing of that sort. Instead,
he laughed lightly as if his mind had been eased of
a burden.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s out of the question, April,” he replied.
“Dorothea wouldn’t betray any one. I’ll stake my
life on that. I don’t know what notion you have in
your head, but there’s a mistake somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Val,” April began earnestly, and then
told him exactly what she had seen and what her
suspicions were.</p>

<p class='c012'>Undoubtedly Tracy was impressed by the story.
No one listening to the intense way in which April
spoke could doubt that she firmly believed what she
said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you certain you saw a Union man?” Tracy
asked, as if it was hard to believe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is not the slightest doubt of it, Val,” she
replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, then, whatever the explanation of her
meeting him may be, he must be taken.” Tracy
had made up his mind at once who this mysterious
person was. Once before he had taken a hand in
helping to free a Federal officer, but then it was an
escaped prisoner from Andersonville and, for the
sake of a sentiment he held, he had closed his eyes
to his duty. That he could not do again. Now a
matter of vital importance to the cause for which he
fought was at stake. He was not one to be indifferent
to his oath of allegiance. He had his own notion
of the meaning of this meeting, but he could not
run the risk of its being nothing but a love affair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you see, Val,” April remarked, “we must
follow Dorothea and capture the fellow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” he answered with a shade of reluctance
in his voice. “Yes, that we must do. Or I must.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going with you,” April insisted. “I want
to do something myself. Oh, if I were only a man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith, and I’m glad you’re not,” Tracy replied,
“but ye shall come if ye want to. If there’s any
shooting to be done I’ll do it, I promise you. But
I hate sneaking up behind a girl. Ye’ll be giving me
countenance, for to tell you the truth I don’t like
warring on women.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It isn’t that, Val,” she assured him. “As far
as Dorothea is concerned, you can leave her to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s just what I don’t want to do,” he replied.
“You females haven’t much pity for each other, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why should I have any pity for one who has
come into our house to play the spy?” demanded
April.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait, my dear, till you’re sure,” Tracy answered.
“I’ll go bail she isn’t betraying anybody;
but we must see for ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well,” April answered, “and now we must
go away from here. She is probably watching us
from her window, and so long as we are in sight she
won’t move. We must give her a chance to get
away unobserved—as she will think. You’d better
go off to the stables. I’ll run up to my room and
let you know when she has gone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Tracy nodded and went off. He didn’t like the
business, but it had to be gone through with.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish April could have found some one else to
help her,” he murmured, as he turned the corner of
the house. “It’s a mean game, this, interfering
with a love affair. But wars no respecter of conventions.
And she’ll hate me for it, bad luck to it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, Dorothea having returned
from a successful trip to the bank was making
for her room when she encountered a
disgruntled Harriot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Dee!” she cried, “that old governess has
come back again and she says I have to work harder
than ever to make up what I’ve lost while she was
away. That means I shan’t have any fun this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What were you going to do?” Dorothea asked,
not having heard of any particular plans.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know,” Harriot confessed, “but it would
have been something very nice, I’m sure. We
should have thought of it, but now I’ve just got to
study, and you’ll go off and have a lovely time by
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That is exactly what Dorothea planned to do the
moment she learned she would be free, but she did
not tell Harriot so.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s too bad,” she murmured sympathetically,
“but there will be other days, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and they’ll be rainy!” Harriot replied
complainingly and with justification, for the weather
had been anything but dry, though there had been a
bright sun for the last week.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But really it’s very warm to-day,” Dorothea
consoled her. “You’ll be cooler in the house than
outdoors. I’m so hot that I’m going upstairs to put
on a cooler dress.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was all true enough, and her walk to the
village had brought a bright flush to her cheeks,
but she had another motive in going upstairs. She
found Lucy ready to help her and her first words to
the girl showed her intention.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pull down the curtain, Lucy,” she said, “there’s
such a glare.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The girl did as she was ordered, but not without
a grumbling protest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does you-all want all the shades down, Miss
Dee?” she asked. “It’s monstrous unlucky.
Looks lak some one was dade.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, just the end one will do,” Dorothea answered.
“I’ve been walking in the sun and I think
a half-light will be pleasanter, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes’m,” Lucy agreed, “but yoh ain’t got no call
to be runnin’ out in the sun that a-way. Little ladies
like you is, should be takin’ their ease and havin’
Lucy fannin’ ’em with a pa’m leaf when it’s so hot.
’Deed, it would sure be a good thing foh that imp
Itty what takes care o’ Miss Harry to have some
wo’k. They says ole Satan always finds some mischief
foh idle hands, an’ I reckon it’s the same
with tongues. That Itty certainly done talk like she
ain’t got nothin’ else to do, ’ceptin’ ’t is slanderin’
folks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s the matter with Itty?” asked Dorothea,
knowing the question was expected of her, though in
reality her thoughts were on Lee Hendon and she
was wondering if he would be able to see her signal.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She’s been braggin’ it over me ’cause she claims
to be bohn a house-servant,” Lucy went on as she
busied herself with Dorothea’s toilet. “An’ she say
you-all ain’t real quality Confedrit like we-all is, so
that it ain’t nothin’ ’t all to take care o’ yoh.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, you just tell her,” Dorothea answered,
laughing, “that my father’s cousin is a real live lord
in England and see what she says to that.” She
chuckled to herself as she thought how little Itty
would be impressed if she could see the red-faced,
hard-riding old aristocrat in his mud-stained pink.
But she guessed that this would give Lucy the
weapon she needed to use among her fellow-workers
in the quarter, and Lucy’s delighted exclamations
of wonder at the information confirmed this view.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is he a sure enough, bang-up quality lord?”
Lucy demanded a little skeptically, as if the news
was too good to be true.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is an earl,” Dorothea announced impressively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My, oh my!” Lucy exclaimed, staring down at
her young mistress in wonder. “Ah’ yoh ain’t
never said nothin’ ’bout it till this minute. Land
sakes, but won’t I tell that Itty somefin’! A Nearl!
I reckon that’s ’most as fine as bein’ a President.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea laughed gayly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think that rather depends upon the President,”
she answered. “But it’s almost as good as a King.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea’s toilet was completed in a blaze of
glory, the only difficulty being that the frocks that
Lucy had formerly admired became, on a sudden,
scarcely magnificent enough for one who claimed so
exalted a relative.</p>

<p class='c012'>After dinner Dorothea suddenly found herself
alone. Miss Imogene slipped upstairs to unpack
and rest after her journey. Harriot went grumblingly
away with her governess. Mrs. May returned
to her spinning-room and April disappeared
with Val Tracy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now is my chance,” Dorothea said to herself,
and ran to her room to put on her hat.</p>

<p class='c012'>Glancing out of the window, she saw April and
Val Tracy strolling over the lawn in deep conversation.
Obviously their talk was of serious interest
to them both; but what Dorothea was most concerned
with was the fact that their presence there
cut her off from going away without being observed.
She wished to slip off without the necessity of explanation
as to where she was going, and should
either of them see her start it would be entirely
natural that they should enquire her errand. Nor
was it at all improbable that Val Tracy might feel
called on to accompany her if she told them she was
off for a walk to Coulter Woods. She dared not run
any risks, and had no wish to excite suspicion by
evasive answers. So she decided to avoid questions.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must wait till they go away,” she said to herself,
and sat down to watch the two.</p>

<p class='c012'>But it was perhaps a half hour before Val and
April separated, Val going off toward the stable and
April coming into the house. Dorothea heard her
cousin enter her room, closing the door with almost
a bang. She waited a moment and then went quietly
down the stairs and so out upon her mission, satisfied
in her own mind that her going had been unobserved.
She had failed to note that April’s door, although
slammed shut, had been opened again just the slightest
crack and that some one standing inside with an
eye to the opening would have a complete view of
all that went on in the hall.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the few minutes that April stood watching
through the crack of the door for Dorothea to leave
her room, she thought over what she was about to
do. For the first time since this war had begun, an
opportunity had been offered her to do something for
the cause. To make bandages, or scrape lint; to
patch worn clothes, to make shift with this or that;
all these things were nothing to one whose whole
heart was set on the winning of the Southern cause.
She was sorry for the soldiers who had to face the
dangers of battle. She mourned their sufferings
and grieved for the blood that must be shed. But
she would have gone to the battle-front with a glad
heart. She longed for an active part, and here, at
last, was an opportunity. To be sure the danger
was slight; but capturing this Northern spy would
be no mean achievement, and would be something
that she could remember with pride to the end of
her days. So, when Dorothea was well on her way,
April found Tracy and together they followed, just
out of sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re sure you know where she’s going?” Val
asked. He was not quite himself. It wasn’t the
sort of game he was in the habit of playing and he
was a little fearful of the outcome. Certainly if he
seized Dorothea’s lover he might expect little further
consideration from her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is no doubt where they will meet,” April
answered with assurance. “Have your pistol
handy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Val nodded, but he hoped there would not be need
of a pistol. It would be useful, in overpowering his
prisoner, but he hoped fervently he would not have
to shoot. It would be bad enough without that.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If they are at the place I saw her last time, we
can come up behind them and they’ll never know till
we appear,” April went on. “I nearly ran them
down yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They went on, keeping just out of sight and taking
the precaution to reconnoiter when they turned corners.
Once or twice they had a glimpse of Dorothea,
flitting steadily ahead with never a glance back
of her. It seemed as if she was perfectly certain
that no one knew her errand, and she walked quickly
as if she longed to be at the rendezvous.</p>

<div id='i003'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus-003.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Young Stanchfield struggled to sit up.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>April and Tracy followed in silence. They did
not have much to say, both being busy with their own
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c012'>And at last they approached the spot where April
had guessed the meeting was to take place. There
was a steep hill with a sharp turn at the top, and
they began the ascent as noiselessly as possible, stepping
cautiously from spot to spot and being careful
not to disturb any loose stones.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t want to have to shoot the fellow,” Val
whispered in April’s ear. “He may give us useful
information and—and anyway, I’d rather not have
any bloodshed if we can help it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To this April made no reply, but after they had
gone a few yards further she laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen,” she said, under her breath.</p>

<p class='c012'>They stopped and in a moment the sound of voices
reached them. First a man’s and then the low voice
of a girl, which they guessed to be Dorothea’s, although
only a murmur was audible.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They have met,” April whispered, her eyes
ablaze with excitement. “Come on.” She tugged
at Val’s sleeve to urge him forward.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take your time,” he cautioned. “Faith, I’ve
seen many a bird missed by shooting too quick.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Cautiously they went forward till they came to the
corner of the path and again paused. Once around
the bend there would be no time for reconsideration.
The action would be immediate. Tracy’s heart
grew heavier as the moment approached when he
would be forced to face Dorothea in the guise of an
enemy. The voices were now more audible and he
caught the words “good-by.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no time to lose.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on.” It was he who urged now, pulling
his pistol from its holster, and with a rush the two
broke from their hiding-place into the open.</p>

<p class='c012'>Facing them stood Dorothea, her eyes wide with
apprehension and surprise; but both Tracy and April
were staring at the back of a man in the hated
Yankee uniform, and for an instant there was a
complete silence. Then Tracy, leveling his pistol at
the man’s back, spoke sternly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Throw up your hands! You are my prisoner,
and if you move I’ll shoot you without mercy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea, aghast, turned her eyes upon the man
before her, and he, startled out of all reason, did not
see that she was as much amazed at this development
as he.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So, you have betrayed me,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>April, with a half smile of triumph on her lips,
looked scornfully at her silent cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are sorry to disturb you, Dorothea,” she
said, “but we shall have to deprive you of your spy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At her words the man whirled and she confronted
Lee Hendon, his face pale and drawn with the anguish
of this unexpected meeting.</p>

<p class='c012'>At sight of him April’s eyes grew round, and for
a moment there was no sound as the two gazed at
each other.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lee! It is Lee!” April murmured, scarcely
knowing what she said, then on a sudden she took a
step forward and threw herself between the two
men.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Run!” she cried, “Run!” and grasped Val
Tracy by the arm that held the pistol.</p>

<p class='c012'>At this sudden change in the situation Val stood
motionless, stunned for the moment at so unexpected
a turn of events.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let go my arm, April,” he cried. “I shan’t let
him run away if I can help it. Let go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But the girl held on, keeping herself between
Tracy and her lover.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Run, Lee, I beg you to run!” she cried again
and again, and at length Hendon, seeming to come
to his senses, took a step toward her, then changed
his mind and plunged into the undergrowth at the
side of the path.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me go, April,” cried Tracy, struggling.
“He will ruin our plans. I cannot let him off.
Please, April.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He struggled as well as he could without hurting
her, but the girl, mad with terror at the possible fate
she had brought on Lee, clung tightly, and in a little
Tracy ceased to struggle and they stood thus till all
sound of Lee’s flight died away. Then April loosed
her hold and, dropping to a fallen log, hid her face
in her hands and sobbed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tracy looked down at her for a moment, then
turned his gaze upon Dorothea. He saw a white
countenance lifted to his, but he might have read the
truth in the clear eyes that met his frankly and fearlessly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith, and it takes a pair of women to make a
fool of a man,” he blurted out. “I wish you joy
of your spies and traitors, Miss Dorothea Drummond.”
And with that he turned on his heel and
quitted the place.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea flushed at Tracy’s words, but she had
none with which to answer him. From the moment
she saw him and April come around the turn in the
path she was too amazed even to think. That they
had been following her and were aware of her
errand was quite apparent, but how they had become
aware of it she could not guess.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now her brain began to clear and she excused
Hendon’s suspicion, realizing how entirely possible
it was for him to think she had betrayed him. Yes,
that was natural enough, and she was sorry. But
what had Tracy in his mind? She had done nothing
that would give him an excuse for saying that
she was playing the part of spy or traitor. To be
sure he had seen her with Larry Stanchfield and now
with Lee Hendon, both in blue uniforms, but he was
assuming too much without giving her a chance to
set herself right. As far as Hendon was concerned,
she could explain that to him when the opportunity
arose. That is, if he asked her to. Time would
attend to that, and in the meanwhile there was April,
sobbing as if her heart would break.</p>

<p class='c012'>And Dorothea was perplexed about this also.
She had been so sure that Lee was in touch with
April and— It was perfectly plain that her cousin
had no idea who the man was she had brought Val
Tracy to capture, for the moment she saw it was Lee
she straightway set about saving him.</p>

<p class='c012'>But then, why should April be crying as if her
heart would break?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps I’m wrong after all,” Dorothea said to
herself, but whatever the reason she could not stand
by and see her cousin breaking her heart without a
word of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Quickly she went to April and put an arm about
her. But April sprang to her feet and turned an
angry, tear-stained face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t touch me!” she cried passionately.
“Don’t touch me. You are an ungrateful Yankee
and you have been spying on us all the time you have
been here!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is not true,” Dorothea began, but April cut
her short.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t attempt to deny it,” she exclaimed, “when
you wear the proof of it!” and she pointed to the
red velvet band on Dorothea’s wrist.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>EXPLANATIONS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Without another word April quitted the
place and Dorothea stood alone in the
woods, stunned by the sudden turn of
events. Lee Hendon had accused her of betraying
him; Val Tracy, for whose opinion she cared more
than for all the rest, had taken for granted that she
had been acting dishonorably; and April had openly
said she was a Red String. She realized fully that,
in the circumstances, all of their suspicions seemed
fully justified. So far as Val was concerned this
was the second time he had found her in communication
with one of his enemies.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But he might have asked me for an explanation,”
she murmured half aloud. That was the
thought that hurt her most. All three had condemned
her without giving her an opportunity to
defend herself. What Lee Hendon might think she
did not care in the slightest. So far as he was concerned,
her task had been performed for Hal’s sake
alone and there her interest in the matter ceased.
April she could forgive, understanding how her
cousin, drawn between her love for her country and
the affection for the man who wore the uniform of
its enemies, had been so distraught that she scarcely
knew what she was saying. But none of these excuses
would serve to justify Val Tracy’s attitude toward
her. She was angry with him, feeling that he
had not been fair, that he had been too ready to
jump to conclusions and condemn her without a
word.</p>

<p class='c012'>Slowly she made her way to the May home, pondering
in her mind what was ahead of her. It
seemed no longer endurable for her to remain with
her aunt, while the increased difficulties of travel
made it well-nigh impossible to go North. And
even there she would not find a home. Her father
was in England and her last letter from him gave no
hint that he could come to America again in the
immediate future. It would take a long time to
communicate with him, and she felt it would be intolerable
to stay in Washington while her cousin
looked upon her as an enemy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she remembered Miss Imogene with a feeling
of relief. That dainty little lady would find
some solution of her difficulties, she felt sure, and
would, if necessary, go away with her until her
father made arrangements for her to join him.</p>

<p class='c012'>As she walked up the drive to the house Harriot
came running down to meet her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where have you been?” was the first question,
and then without pausing for a reply, “Val Tracy
has gone! Went off and hardly said good-by—and
April’s up in her room with the door locked.
What do you think is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Evidently Harriot had seen enough to excite her
curiosity, but as yet she did not connect Dorothea
with the disturbance in any way.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose Captain Tracy has had orders,”
Dorothea answered evasively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think so,” Harriot confided in an undertone.
“I think he and April have had a tiff; and
that’s funny, too; because of course I believed she
was in love with Lee Hendon. Didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, indeed,” Dorothea replied enthusiastically,
glad of one question she need not evade.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, you can’t tell,” Harriot went on judicially.
“When they get in love there’s no counting on what
they’ll do, no matter who it is they’re in love with.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She chattered on, enlarging on her views of that
fatal malady, love, quite unmindful of the fact that
Dorothea added little to the conversation. She was
aware of a certain satisfaction in the fact that Harriot
was wrong in her surmises. She knew that
April was not in love with Val Tracy, but this did
not by any means insure that Val was as indifferent
to April.</p>

<p class='c012'>She managed to escape after a time and went
directly to her room. She wanted to think before
she talked to Miss Imogene about the afternoon’s
adventure. There were many things to consider,
and not the least of these was how far she might go
in discussing April’s affairs. It gave her no right,
as Dorothea saw it, to betray a confidence simply
because her cousin had put a wrong interpretation
upon her actions. She had done her best to keep
the knowledge that Lee Hendon wore a blue uniform
to herself. That had plainly been Hal’s wish, and
now that two others knew of it she saw no very
good reason why she should tell a third. But, on
the other hand, how could she explain her position
without recounting the facts of the case? She
wanted advice, for she felt the time had come when
she could no longer stay at her aunt’s, yet she
doubted her right to openly explain the matter upon
which she sought guidance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Why Tracy had gone away she could not guess,
unless it was that he did not wish to be near April
now that he was assured of her love for Lee Hendon.
That must have been quite plain to him, for the agony
in April’s voice when she shouted to Hendon to run,
left no doubt about the state of her feelings toward
him. Dorothea concluded that here was the most
reasonable explanation for Val’s sudden departure,
and she sighed.</p>

<p class='c012'>On top of this conclusion, she realized suddenly
that unless some better excuse than she could
then think of for going away was forthcoming she
would be obliged to make an explanation to her Aunt
Parthenia. It was impossible for her to say, indifferently,
that she had decided to go back to England.
Mrs. May would never be satisfied with that, and
would doubtless forbid her to stir until she had heard
directly from her father. But the same scruples that
kept her from talking to Miss Imogene were equally
effective with her aunt. The matter so closely concerned
April that the more Dorothea thought of it
the less she felt inclined to discuss it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must wait,” she concluded finally, “and if I
have a chance I shall speak to April.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This definite decision taken, she was forced to act
as if nothing had happened, but determined, at the
first opportunity that presented itself, to talk openly
to her cousin and so put an end to a situation she
felt to be intolerable.</p>

<p class='c012'>But this opportunity failed to come at once.
That night at supper April appeared as usual, indeed
Dorothea could note no change in her manner;
all traces of tears were gone and she seemed her
bright vivacious self. There was some talk of
Tracy’s sudden departure, but April gave no hint
that she was aware of any reason for it, and to those
who knew nothing of the afternoon’s occurrences it
was easy to account for it as due to the exigencies of
the war. Toward Dorothea she showed no change,
so far as the girl could see, and this confirmed her
conclusion that April wished the matter kept secret.
Otherwise she would have spoken out, at least to her
mother, and Dorothea was sure that her Aunt Parthenia
would not be one to let her rest under any
suspicion without giving her a chance to explain the
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was just one person who could set the matter
straight in the main, at least; and he was lying in
bed sorely wounded. Dorothea could not take her
grievances to him while he was in this condition, but
when Hal had sufficiently recovered to be down on
the gallery in the sun Dorothea made up her mind
that she would speak to him some day when they
were alone together and see that he informed April
of the exact circumstances of her meeting with Lee
Hendon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Strangely enough April had come to the same conclusion
from an entirely different standpoint. She
thoroughly believed in Dorothea’s guilt. There was
no doubt in her mind that her accusation had been
just and that her cousin was a Red String. To her
thinking, the English girl had taken advantage of
her relationship with them to come South and spy
upon the Confederacy. She was not quite logical
even with herself; but although suspicion had more
than once entered her mind, it was only when she
believed herself thoroughly justified that she permitted
these vague doubts to take a definite form.
Now that she had seen Dorothea in communication
with Lee Hendon she had found the necessary proof
for her intuitive distrust, and there was nothing she
could not have believed Dorothea capable of to further
the cause of the Yankees. She thought it entirely
possible that the girl had been in constant communication
with Hendon, supplying him with information
she had picked up from Hal and Val Tracy
or the many officers who had stayed with them from
time to time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her first intention was to go to her mother and
tell her flatly that Dorothea could no longer stay
there. But, upon thinking it over, she saw the weakness
of her position with Mrs. May. If the spy had
been any one but Lee Hendon there would have been
no hesitation; but here was the man she loved deeply
involved—and she had saved him from capture!
That act she excused to herself, and perhaps here lay
an added reason for her bitterness toward Dorothea.
Also her mother, frankly lukewarm toward the
Southern cause, would be ready enough to defend
Dorothea to the last; but the argument that had most
weight in her thoughts was that here was a matter
that concerned primarily the head of the house. Her
father should be the one to determine what should
be done in such a case; for, in a measure, she conceived
the honor of family to be at stake; but Colonel
May was quite inaccessible, so naturally she concluded
that Hal must take their father’s place.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, like Dorothea, she had no wish to burden
Hal until he was convalescent. She counted upon
the fact that Dorothea would do nothing until she
was forced to, attributing the most obvious motives
to her, convinced that she would remain in Washington
as long as she could in the hope of gaining further
information that would be useful to the Northern
armies. But she felt herself a match for her
cousin, who, she had the satisfaction of knowing,
never left the place unobserved.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last April determined that Hal was well enough
to hear her story and, with a sense of fairness, she
determined that Dorothea should be present. With
that in view she ascertained that, save for Big Jim,
Hal was alone on the piazza and went upstairs to
fetch Dorothea. On her way up, however, she met
her cousin coming down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was just coming up for you,” April remarked.
“I want you to come out and see Hal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was just going to see him,” Dorothea replied
calmly, and together the two went out on the porch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m in luck to-day,” Hal cried as the two sat
down, one on either side of him. “Two such lovely
females all to myself is an unexpected pleasure,” and
he smiled at Dorothea; but, receiving no answering
smile, he looked from one to the other, sensing a
seriousness in their visit that puzzled him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Big Jim,” April said to the boy, “you may go to
the Quarters till you’re sent for.” And with a grin
the colored lad went off.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s up?” asked Hal. “You look as if
there was more bad news.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Hal, it isn’t that,” April responded quickly,
“but it isn’t cheerful news, either. I have a very
disagreeable task to perform, but it must be done.
Our cousin Dorothea is one of this band of Red
Strings!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She made the announcement as calmly as she
could, but there was the light of excited indignation
in her eyes and she could not keep a trace of scorn out
of her tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hal turned toward Dorothea with a questioning
glance. Certain things had happened that had led
him to the suspicion that there might be some one
about the place who was not entirely loyal, but he
had never seen anything to make him positive of it.
Instantly all these past suspicions flashed over him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It can’t be <i>you</i>, Dorothea!” he exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you think there was a spy about here, Hal?”
April cried, seizing upon the implication his question
suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Hal answered, with growing resentment.
“Ever since that night they came looking for that
escaped prisoner from Andersonville. I was never
satisfied about that. The men were certain the dogs
tracked him to this house. It was here the trail
stopped.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Dorothea was out alone on the porch that
night,” April cut in. “Isn’t that true?” she demanded,
turning to the girl.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, it is,” Dorothea answered. “But so were
you, for that matter. That doesn’t prove I’m a Red
String, any more than that you are. You don’t have
to go back that far, April. Tell Hal what happened
lately. That’s what I was going to tell him.”
Of the three Dorothea was now the calmest.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hal turned an inquiring glance toward his sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What happened?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorothea met a Union officer in Coulter
Woods!” April announced it with an air of finality.
She had no wish to volunteer information
about who that officer was, although she had no
hope that her cousin would keep the matter secret.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that true, too?” asked Hal.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Dorothea nodded, and she could not help
smiling a little.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is no matter to laugh about!” April burst out
passionately. “Hal, we have been betrayed. It
is not only that she has met this man, but she had
information to put at naught plans we had for a fine
stroke. Val Tracy was there, too. He knows—and
there’s no telling how much it might have done
for the Cause.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She would have gone on but at the moment a
clatter of horse’s hoofs galloping up the drive drew
the attention of all, and they saw Val Tracy racing
toward the house. A few minutes later he flung himself
in a chair beside them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith, this is a fine little gathering!” he exclaimed
irritably. “We have been betrayed, April.
The enemy has been informed. I’ll leave you to say
for yourself whose fault it was.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you know?” April demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have been after the man since last I saw you,”
Val went on. “I’ve had the whole countryside looking
for him—but without result. And now I get
this.” He fumbled in his tunic and drew out a yellow
dispatch, which he proceeded to read: “‘Plans
betrayed by Union officer traced from Washington.’
There you are! Can anything be plainer?”</p>

<p class='c012'>April turned white and wrung her hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s this all about, Val?” demanded Hal.
“We’re having all sorts of accusations and what
not, but I don’t know what you’re all driving at.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s quickly told,” Tracy answered. “We
planned to recapture Savannah. It was a secret.
There weren’t half a dozen knew of it. Well, it
seems that in some way Dorothea learned it, and we
saw her talking to a Union officer in the woods.
Our plans were betrayed. I’ll leave you to put two
and two together.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a momentary hush and then Hal turned
to Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Haven’t you anything to say in your own defense?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have only been accused of meeting a Union
officer in the woods,” she replied gravely enough
now. “I cannot deny that. I did meet him.
Twice.”</p>

<div id='i004'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus-004.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Dorothea met a Union officer in Coulter Woods.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Did you tell him of these plans?” Hal asked.
There was something about Dorothea’s straightforward
look that gave him confidence in her word.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” Dorothea answered promptly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must have!” April burst out. “Who else
could have told him? You don’t deny that you
knew of them?”</p>

<p class='c012'>For the first time Dorothea hesitated. She did
know of them from Larry Stanchfield; but she was
reluctant to admit it, seeing the obvious inference
that would be drawn. On the other hand she was
in no mood to tell anything but the truth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I did know of them,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you expect us to believe you did not tell this
man you met in the woods?” Hal said, sternly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course I expect you to believe me,” Dorothea
answered, a blaze of anger coming into her eyes.
“That is exactly what I do expect you to do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But who else could have told the man?” Hal
went on. “No one but you and Val, apparently,
knew of it and we have been betrayed. You can’t
expect me to think Val betrayed himself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There was one other who knew,” Tracy cut in,
sharply. “I told April, like a fool!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you think I would have told?” April demanded
with blazing eyes. “I would have died
first.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“April is loyal to the core!” Hal defended his
sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think she would tell,” Tracy agreed, “but
I don’t think Dorothea would either.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you, Val,” Dorothea said, softly. She
did not care what the others thought at that moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what other motive could she have had for
meeting him?” April persisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To help the man, if she’s the Red String you
say she is,” Hal put in quickly. “Did you go to
help him, Dorothea?” he questioned her directly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, that’s just what I did,” she answered, “but
I am not a Red String any more than I am a
traitor!”</p>

<p class='c012'>April shrugged her shoulders. It was so entirely
evident that she was, or had been, in communication
with their enemies that it seemed as if Dorothea
could not be telling the truth. She had admitted
knowledge of an undertaking so secret that but a few
knew of it. And now it had failed, and everything
pointed to Dorothea as the one responsible for the
failure. As to Lee Hendon, he was, apparently,
now an avowed enemy and, as such, even she could
not take exception to his action.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s just one thing I don’t understand,” Hal
broke in upon April’s thoughts. “How does it come
that you and Tracy know all about this meeting of
Dorothea’s?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We saw them together,” April answered, not
realizing where this was leading.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then why did you let the man get away?” demanded
Hal, turning to Val.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will have to ask your sister that,” Tracy
replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hal turned to April with an inquiring glance and
the girl saw that she must make some explanation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The man was Lee Hendon, Hal,” she replied in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lee Hendon!” exclaimed Hal, suddenly enlightened.
“Lee Hendon! And you saw him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I saw him with Dorothea,” April broke out.
“I followed her, not knowing who the man was she
went to meet, and we have not yet had any satisfactory
answer as to why Dorothea did meet him. That
we must have, if she is to stay any longer in this
house.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can give you that, April,” Hal answered
quietly. “Dorothea met Lee Hendon at my request.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“At your request!” April repeated in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Hal went on. “Lee Hendon saved my
life, no matter what uniform he was wearing, and I
was in his debt for that. Dorothea undertook to
discharge that debt. I think we all owe her an
apology.”</p>

    <div>MR. DAVIS MAKES A SPEECH</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Hal’s announcement came like a bursting
bombshell to April and Val Tracy. The
latter half turned away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m an idiot!” he exclaimed to no one in particular.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is no need for anybody to apologize,”
Dorothea protested earnestly. “I’ve understood it
all along. Of course you thought I was giving information
to Mr. Hendon. I should have thought
the same; but I hoped it would all be explained as
soon as Hal was well. I didn’t want to bother him
about it at first, and I wasn’t sure he wanted me to
talk about it. That’s why I didn’t tell you in the
beginning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hal told the story of how Hendon had brought
him back and in a little while every one was apparently
satisfied. April said she was sorry, and Dorothea
forgave her promptly; but there was still a hint
of reservation in April’s manner. There were other
things that were not clear to her. She was by no
means satisfied that Dorothea was free from all the
blame. There were still matters that required clearing
up, but she was not the sort of a girl to defend
herself by stating vague suspicions and, though there
was no very great warmth in her words to Dorothea,
they were a confession of her fault and were as gracious
as she could make them.</p>

<p class='c012'>And Dorothea had no wish to appear triumphant.
The only grievance she had was that it had been
taken for granted that no excuse was possible and
that appearances should determine the matter so
completely. But this she was willing to forget. She
was glad that the misunderstanding was ended, and
although she realized that April had yet to be won
completely, she hoped in time to accomplish that
also.</p>

<p class='c012'>After supper that night Val Tracy sought her out,
and for a few moments they were alone on the lawn.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t deserve to have you speak to me,” he
told her. “And I’m not one to make excuses, but,
faith! I was a bit upset.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course you were,” she answered readily with
a smile. “It was very upsetting all ’round. I was
so surprised when you came rushing up that I couldn’t
say a word.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I had to let the fellow off, knowing all the
time what was depending upon it,” he answered.
“I’ll be glad when this pesky war is over—and it
won’t be very long now or I’m greatly mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the South will lose?” Dorothea half questioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tracy shook his head affirmatively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It has lost!” he admitted. “Not that I would
say that to any one but you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad,” Dorothea said, impulsively. “And
I shouldn’t say that to any one but you!” she added
with a low laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>He smiled in answer, but his face went grave in a
moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you’re against us, after all,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, that isn’t quite it, either,” Dorothea tried
to explain. “I’m not against anybody. At least
not as I see it now. Mr. Lincoln, you know, started
me thinking long ago. But, since I’ve been here, it
seems as if it was only the South that was against
things—and they don’t understand. It is when the
war is over that they will see how mistaken they have
been. Then they’ll find that Mr. Lincoln is their best
friend. You know, Captain Tracy,” she went on,
lowering her voice a little, “Mr. Lincoln would be a
friend to anybody who gave him a chance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You seem a great admirer of his,” Tracy said
shortly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so would you be, if you knew him,” she replied
promptly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maybe,” he replied, “and, sure, you’d be the
one to convince me. But I’m not hiding the fact that
I don’t like to be fighting on the losing side. If it
hadn’t been for Hendon we might have pulled
through after all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you mean you think he gave the information
to the Yankees about your plan?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course I do,” he replied. “Who else was
there?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, it wasn’t Mr. Hendon,” Dorothea returned
positively. “He didn’t know about it.
How could he have known if I didn’t tell him? And
I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faith, that’s the truth,” Tracy admitted with a
shake of his head. “I had it so firmly in my mind
that he was a traitor that I forgot to put two and
two together. Are you sure, though?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course I can’t be absolutely positive,” Dorothea
explained. “But I can assure you he didn’t
learn of it from me, and—” she hesitated a moment,
“and I have seen a man who did know of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked at her a moment closely, then shook
his head slowly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s not for me to doubt what you say or to ask
questions,” he began; but she interrupted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One thing I should like you to understand,” she
said. “I had no hand in it, either directly or indirectly.
It was all an accident, my finding out.
Please believe that I wouldn’t stay here in this house
and abuse its hospitality.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Tracy could have no doubt of Dorothea’s sincerity,
so earnestly did she speak. “I wish I’d
known that a bit sooner,” he remarked soberly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would it have made any difference?” Dorothea
questioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It may make a difference to Hendon,” Tracy replied.
“To tell you the truth,” he went on, “for
another reason we suspected Hendon hadn’t brought
the news to the Yanks. We didn’t see how he could
have gotten through to them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean by that?” Dorothea asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When I left here after that little play we had in
the woods yonder,” Tracy explained, “I went out to
alarm the country. It was too serious a matter, you
understand, to let the whims of a girl thwart us. I
couldn’t fight with April over taking the man then
and there; but—well, at any rate, in an hour there
was a party looking for Hendon and I went on to
give the warning as wide a range as I could. I
guessed Hendon knew from you. April overheard
you talking to Miss Imogene. I was sure what he
was after and I cut off his road to the Yankees.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then he was captured?” Dorothea demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not that I’ve heard of,” Val acknowledged.
“I’ve even been thinking he might have gotten
through, seeing that the Yanks were warned; but
now—” He whistled softly to himself. “They
may get him yet—and if they do—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What will they do?” Dorothea’s tone was
anxious.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tracy shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The man is a Southerner turned Yankee. You
can guess the rest,” he answered shortly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But they can’t do anything more than take him
prisoner!” Dorothea exclaimed. She had no special
interest in Lee Hendon save for April’s sake,
but Tracy’s tone was suggestive of something serious.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish I could be sure of that,” Tracy replied
gravely. “You see, they are an irregular band of
militia and will have small regard for the law in
such cases. They will consider him not only a spy
but a traitor.” He shook his head dubiously.
“We mustn’t speak of this to April.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But we must do something,” Dorothea insisted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but I don’t know what has become of him,”
Tracy explained. “He may be all right, after all,
you know. At any rate I shall make it my business
to find out. But, under any circumstances, April
must not know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Secrecy, they agreed, was necessary, and that same
evening Tracy went off again to try to find some
trace of Hendon.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next day the news reached little Washington
that President Lincoln had been assassinated.
There were few details and for some little time no
one knew positively who the murderer was, and there
were many fantastic rumors flying about.</p>

<p class='c012'>Upon Dorothea the sad event made a deep impression,
deeper than even she realized at the time.
Once more she brought back to her mind the scene in
which the great and kindly man had shown her his
heart for a moment, and his death seemed a personal
loss to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>But out of the sadness came a crystallizing of all
the vague feelings that had struggled for expression
almost from the very day she had arrived in the
South. She felt now that her real sympathy had
always been for the North and that she was glad
that they had won. Not that she lacked sympathy
and understanding for her rebel relatives. She had
no preconceived prejudices to warp her judgment,
but great principles had been involved in this war
that was now practically ended, and Dorothea knew
that they had been upheld by the North under the
leadership of Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c012'>Indeed there was no rejoicing in the May household
over the fact that the man who had beaten
the Confederacy was dead. Mrs. May said openly
and with truth that the South had lost her best friend.
Even April expressed her indignation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are not murderers!” she exclaimed, and
Dorothea was glad that her cousins, with all their
strong Southern loyalty, had no excuses for so cowardly
a deed.</p>

<p class='c012'>The days that followed brought a realizing sense
to even the most hopeful Confederate that the war
was over and that the South had lost; but Jefferson
Davis still clung to the shadow of his position, and,
though he was in flight from Virginia, there was
talk of a new government being instituted in Texas,
to which state he was then trying to make his way.</p>

<p class='c012'>During these days Dorothea waited anxiously for
the return of Val Tracy. Lee Hendon’s actions
were not quite clear to her and although she was
glad the Union had won she could not hide from herself
that this young man’s course did not always stir
her admiration. Nevertheless she realized that he
was in a perilous position and would have been glad
to know he was safe.</p>

<p class='c012'>And then, in an unusual flutter even for them,
Mrs. Stewart and Corinne arrived one Sunday with
a momentous announcement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our dear President Davis is in Washington!”
the elder lady cried as she met each of the family in
turn. “He has honored our town as it has never
been honored before in all history, except when
Washington, the first Rebel president, visited it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea was surprised to find that even April
greeted this news with little enthusiasm. She had
had hints from time to time that her relations were
not always in sympathy with Mr. Davis and upon
one occasion she had overheard Hal say, rather bitterly,
“Our President is nothing but a politician!”
But she was rather surprised at their indifference to
his arrival in Washington.</p>

<p class='c012'>She, on the other hand, had a distinct curiosity to
see this man who had been so prominent a figure
during the four terrible years through which the
United States had just passed, and when she learned
from Mrs. Stewart that a reception was to be held
in Mr. Davis’s honor that afternoon she did not conceal
her desire to go.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll go with you,” Harriot announced. “They
always have something to eat at receptions.” But
none of the others in the family gave any indication
that they were even mildly interested and shortly
Mrs. Stewart went away, expressing pointedly her
opinion that the whole May family were half Yankees,
after all.</p>

<p class='c012'>Harriot and Dorothea went to the reception and
found the place crowded with fulsome admirers of
Mr. Davis, prominent among whom was Mrs. Stewart,
who seemed to hang upon the great man’s words
as if an oracle spoke. The two girls viewed this
from a distance, and it was not until Mr. Davis consented
to make a little speech and stood upon a chair
that Dorothea really had a good view of him.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was a tall, aristocratic-looking man with blue
eyes, but with the refinement of feature there was
also a hint of vanity and weakness. Yet to Dorothea
there was something that suggested that real
President she had seen in the other Washington.
What it was she could not have said, but there was a
resemblance that brought a pang to her heart and a
wonder that these two antagonists in so great a
struggle should resemble each other even in the
slightest degree. In character they were as wide
apart as the poles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea listened to the speech Mr. Davis made
with only half an ear, until suddenly she became
aware that he was saying something that interested
her vitally.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our Sacred Cause is not dead,” Mr. Davis insisted,
with the round, ringing tones of the political
orator. “Our beloved South has sent her sons from
every corner of its fertile lands. Even here in little
Washington I could tell you a tale of bravery unsurpassed
in the annals of history. The young man of
whom I speak has asked that his secret be kept, but
I cannot resist the temptation to tell you. This native
son, this youth who has grown up among you,
was forced by circumstances to stay at home during
the early years of the war; but there came a time
when he was free, and he journeyed to us, begging
for the most dangerous mission upon which he could
embark. From the beginning his heart was in our
great Cause and because he could not do his utmost
at the start he wished a doubly hazardous part to
play. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen of Washington,
that this gentleman donned the uniform of a
Union officer and went into our implacable enemies’
lines and from there sent us information of inestimable
value. Every moment he was risking his life—at
any hour he might have paid the penalty for his
bravery by a disgraceful death. Indeed I do not
know to-day whether he is alive or dead. He may
have found a martyr’s grave for the sake of our dear
Confederacy, and that is one reason why I am telling
you, his friends, this story. Have you not guessed
of whom I speak? It is of Lee Hendon, whose
name, bequeathed to him by honored—”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this point Dorothea lost track of what Mr.
Davis was saying. In a flash everything was clear
to her and a great impulse to run to April with this
news brought her to her feet and, without a thought
of Harriot, she left the building and started for
home, half running.</p>

<p class='c012'>In her thoughts was but one object: to tell April
that her lover was an honorable man; there was no
room in her mind for anything else as she hurried
to the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the front door she met Merry.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Miss April?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Land sakes, Miss Dee!” exclaimed Merry, her
eyes opening wide with surprise. “You sure is in a
hurry. Lil’ Miss, she’s upstaihs in her room, I
reckon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea did not wait to explain, but climbing the
stairs, two steps at a time, she went directly to
April’s room and, without the formality of knocking,
burst open the door and rushed in.</p>

<p class='c012'>April, sitting by her desk, glanced up, a look of
annoyance coming into her face; but this changed
on the instant at her cousin’s words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, April!” cried Dorothea, with a sob in her
voice, “he isn’t a traitor after all. He’s been a
Confederate spy all the time, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who are you talking about?” demanded April,
now on her feet, a bright light of happiness coming
into her eyes as she guessed at the meaning of this
abrupt announcement. “Who is it, Dorothea?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, Lee Hendon, of course!” came the happy
answer.</p>

    <div>A RACE AGAINST DEATH</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was inevitable that sooner or later April and
Dorothea should understand each other and be
free to express the warm feeling each had in her
heart for the other. And here was the incident that
was to break down all barriers of misunderstanding.
April realized that Dorothea, with a quick sympathy,
had hurried to her with the news that would be
more welcome than any other. For an instant they
looked deep into each other’s eyes and then April
took her cousin in her arms and hugged her close.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so it was poor Lee you saw at the window
that night,” April said an hour or so later. “I
didn’t know he was there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I thought you had gone out to meet him,”
Dorothea explained.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no,” exclaimed April with a blush. “If I’d
known he was there I shouldn’t have gone. I was
such a stubborn, stupid girl. No, I didn’t go to
meet him, but, you know, Dee, it was an anniversary,
that night, the anniversary of the day Lee asked me
to marry him. I didn’t forget that, you know, and—and—well,
I couldn’t stand it any more. I had
to get away by myself for a minute or two and I
didn’t want any one to know. And Lee remembered
too. I wish I could see him and ask him to forgive
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And then for the first time Dorothea recollected
that Lee Hendon might be in peril of his life at that
moment. In the excitement of discovering the real
truth about him she had forgotten what Tracy had
told her, and her heart held a sudden pang of anxiety.</p>

<p class='c012'>“April,” she said, gently, “I think I ought to tell
you that Mr. Hendon may be a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“With the Yankees?” April demanded with a
sudden whitening of her face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, with some one of the Confederate bands,”
Dorothea answered, and then told her cousin all that
Tracy feared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But all Lee would have to do is to say what he
had been doing,” April insisted. “If he told his
captors that he was really a Southern spy, although
he wore a blue uniform—” She broke off suddenly,
realizing that her words did not ring true. She
herself would be very skeptical of a man who had
apparently shown no enthusiasm for the Confederacy
and later had been taken in the garb of its enemies.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorothea,” she cried, her eyes widening with
apprehension, “did Val believe there was any danger?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” Dorothea answered, thinking no good
would come of hiding anything. “He was afraid
Mr. Hendon might have been captured by men who
would take the law into their own hands.”</p>

<p class='c012'>April jumped to her feet with a sharp cry.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But they mustn’t have their own way!” she exclaimed.
“Something must be done at once.
Where did Val say Lee was?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He didn’t know,” Dorothea answered. “He
went out to look for him. You see, he put the men
on Mr. Hendon’s trail, fancying he was a Union spy
who was trying to warn the Federal soldiers in Savannah.
When I saw Captain Tracy last he didn’t
know that Mr. Hendon had been captured, though
he thought it likely. I don’t know where either of
them are now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But there must be something we can do,” April
insisted. “We can’t sit here and just wait. They
may kill Lee. Oh, Dorothea,” she sobbed, “it was
I that set Val Tracy after Lee. If I hadn’t been so
suspicious of you, he would have been out of harm’s
way now. Oh, what shall I do if anything happens
to Lee?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She sank down in a chair, sobbing as if her heart
would break and Dorothea, her own eyes wet with
sympathetic tears, tried to comfort her, knowing all
the while how inadequate were words to lighten such
anxiety.</p>

<p class='c012'>But April was not one of those girls who do nothing
but cry when misfortune overtakes them. In a
very few minutes she dried her tears and became her
brave, resolute self.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorothea, there must be something we can do,”
she said emphatically. “Didn’t Val give you a hint
of where he might be going?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea shook her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He had no idea himself, April,” she replied.
“Captain Tracy had roused the whole country, hoping
to capture Mr. Hendon before he could get
through to Savannah.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She would have gone on but, on answering a knock
at the door, they found Lucy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please, Miss Dee,” began the colored maid,
“there’s a boy down stairs wantin’ mighty bad to
see you-all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To see me?” Dorothea questioned, not knowing
who it could possibly be. “What kind of a boy,
Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, jes’ one of ’em ordinary boys, Miss,” answered
the girl as if she were giving an entirely
adequate description. “I reckon he’s come some
ways, seein’ he’s ridin’ a poor, skin-and-bones mule.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Together the girls went down and found a farmer’s
boy, twelve years old or so, who, in answer to
their questions, silently produced a folded sheet of
paper with Dorothea’s name written on the outside.</p>

<p class='c012'>Quickly she opened it, glanced at the signature and
saw that it was from Val Tracy; then she read as
follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have found Hendon. He is in the hands of a
band of Irregulars who insist upon executing him as
a spy. I have done everything I can, but it is of no
use. They won’t let me even see him, but have
brought me a message from him. He wants to see
April before he dies, and the men have given us
twenty-four hours. That means sunset to-morrow.
I don’t know whether she will consent to come, but
the least I could do was to make this effort to get
her. I should, perhaps, have gone to her myself,
but it would seem like abandoning Hendon and I am
still trying to persuade these men that, although he
is an enemy, they have no right to kill him. Somehow
I feel dreadfully sorry for Hendon, but I am
afraid he is doomed. If you can persuade April to
come, the boy who bears this will show her the way.
I shall see you as soon as this dreadful business is
over. Yours faithfully, Val Tracy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea read the letter through rapidly, then,
handing it to April, who stood beside her, she addressed
the boy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When did you get this letter from Captain
Tracy?” she demanded in a businesslike tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>The boy was visibly embarrassed and hung his
head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I done brung it as fast as I could, considerin’,”
he mumbled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But when did you get it?” Dorothea repeated
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Las’ night,” he answered sullenly; “but I didn’t
see no call to go ridin’ in the dark. ’Sides, some o’
them swamps is ha’nted!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How far did you ride?” April asked. She had
read Val Tracy’s letter and realized the well-nigh
hopeless situation in which her lover stood; but she
wasted no time in tears or vain repinings. There
blazed in her brilliant eyes a look of determination
that meant action.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How far did you ride?” she questioned again
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I reckon it’d be a matter of thirty-five miles or
so,” the boy answered reluctantly. “I come as fast
as I could and left home long before daylight—long
before; but them swamps is ha’nted—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dorothea,” April broke in upon the boy’s excuses,
“Val expected us to get this message hours
ago. We shall have to start at once and perhaps,
even then, we’ll be too late. Will you help me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” answered Dorothea promptly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then if you’ll have Uncle Jastrow put the best
pair of horses in the light carriage and tell him to
come to the Heath House at once, with the boy, I
shall go with him to save Lee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She was moving as she spoke. Inside she found a
hat and glanced at the tall clock in the hall. “I
shall only have five hours before sunset.” She
paused a moment and put her hand to her heart as if
there were a sharp pain there. “Thirty-five miles
in five hours,” she murmured under her breath. “I
must do it. I must do it!” she cried loudly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We will do it!” Dorothea exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>By this time April was out again and starting down
the drive.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going to President Davis to get an order
from him for Lee’s release. Send Jastrow there for
me and you explain to mother. Good-by.” And
April hurried away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea, as ready to act as her beautiful cousin,
went to the abashed boy and grasping him by the
shoulder led him into the house where she handed
him over to Aunt Decent to be fed. At the same
time she sent word to Uncle Jastrow. Then she
sought her Aunt Parthenia.</p>

<p class='c012'>It took but a moment or two to explain the situation
and immediately Mrs. May, grown used to meeting
sudden emergencies, got to work to further the
expedition with all speed.</p>

<p class='c012'>While Uncle Jastrow was being informed of what
was before him, Harriot saw to having a lunch prepared
and in a surprisingly short time all was ready.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea meanwhile had gotten some warm wraps
for April, and she came down from her room dressed
for the journey.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. May seeing her preparations and realizing
Dorothea’s intentions, kissed her lovingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was going with April but I shall feel that she
is safe with you, dear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A little later the traveling carriage driven by
Uncle Jastrow, with the boy beside him on the box,
stopped in front of the Heath House and April came
running to meet them.</p>

<p class='c012'>At sight of Dorothea she paused a moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t think of your coming,” April murmured
as she jumped in and settled down beside her cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course I meant to go with you all the time,”
said Dorothea in a matter-of-fact tone, and April
kissed her, tears too near for speech.</p>

<p class='c012'>Under constant urging from April, Uncle Jastrow
had driven the horses at as fast a gait as they could
go. But the shadows were lengthening and there
were still untraveled miles ahead of them. During
the long hours the girls had scarcely spoken to each
other, but much of the time had sat, hand in hand,
looking at the ribbon of road ahead of them as the
horses galloped mile after mile. Under the most
favorable circumstances the task set would have been
a hard one, but there was a determination behind
April’s quiet manner that meant a battle against any
force that might attempt to hold her back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faster, Uncle Jastrow!” she said, in a steady
voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Deed, Lil’ Miss,” the old darky answered,
“they’s doin’ all they can, ’less yoh want ’em dyin’
on the road.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faster!” was all the reply April made, and the
driver, with a shake of his white head, urged on the
tiring beasts.</p>

<p class='c012'>They watched the shadows growing longer and
longer. It was a race, with everything against the
weary horses reaching their destination before the
descending sun gave the signal for the death of
April’s lover.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faster, Uncle Jastrow!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The words were becoming more and more frequent,
and April, sitting straight and tense, gazed
ahead with burning eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Through woods and swamps; past fields of green
grain, over small bridges that rattled as they sped
by; up hill and down they hastened on under the
direction of the boy who pointed out the turnings.
Dorothea had tried not to consider the possibility of
being too late; but now she was unable to control
the despair clutching at her heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How much farther is it?” she demanded of the
boy in the seat directly before her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must be a matter of ten mile yet,” he replied
over his shoulder. Stolid as he was, his youth had
caught the spirit of the grim contest and seemed to
resent being forced to take his eyes from the road
before them.</p>

<p class='c012'>At his words a sort of sob came through the tightened
lips of old Uncle Jastrow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Deed, Lil’ Miss, we can’t make it!” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must!” came April’s unfaltering words.
“We must make it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s bound to kill ’em!” the old darky answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are a dozen horses to the life of Marse
Lee Hendon, Uncle Jastrow?” the girl replied
firmly. “Faster! Faster!”</p>

<p class='c012'>In that last ten miles of the journey, the horses,
tiring rapidly, seemed to stumble at every step. The
old colored man, driving with the skill he had learned
from his father before him, kept his team on their
feet and seemed to help them on step by step. Their
labored breathing would have pained those who
heard, had their errand been of less moment. But
nothing could be spared if Lee Hendon’s life was to
be saved.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faster, Uncle Jastrow, faster!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The words were almost continuous now as the
horses staggered over the remaining miles and the
sun dropped lower and lower.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s only three more miles now,” the boy
cried as they turned a corner. But the colored
driver shook his head anxiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They jes’ cain’t do it!” he said under his breath
and to prove his words, one of the exhausted horses,
stumbling, made a brave effort to keep its feet, but
too weak, fell with a gasp and the carriage came to
a sudden stop.</p>

<p class='c012'>With a cry of distress April leaped to the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come with me!” she cried to the boy. “Show
me the way. We’ll run the rest of the distance.
Hurry!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But before they had well started a mounted man
galloped around the bend and, with a shout, reined
up beside them.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Val Tracy, coming to look for them, and
with barely a word of greeting April thrust the order
she had secured from Mr. Davis into his hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ride back, Val; read that on your way!” she
commanded, and Tracy, knowing that there was not
a moment to lose, glanced at the darkening sky and
driving his spurs into his horse, tore back along the
road he had come. In a moment he was out of
sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>April and Dorothea sitting on a fallen log beside
the road waited while the slowly passing minutes
marked the gathering shadows or the night. The
sun had set long since, and at the moment of its setting
the sound of a distant rifle shot sent a tremor of
apprehension through the girls, but neither dared
acknowledge she had heard it. Words were of no
avail in that tense hour of agonized waiting. In
the mind of each was the one question that banished
all other thoughts until it should be answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Had Val reached there in time?” They could
not know until the young Captain returned, and so
they waited in an agony of suspense.</p>

<p class='c012'>Uncle Jastrow and the boy worked over the horses,
which slowly recovered from their heart-breaking
race; but the girls were scarcely conscious of what
went on about them. Their ears were strained to
catch the first sounds of a galloping horse coming
back over the road by which Val had departed.
And each heard the distant thud of hoofs at the
same instant. Dorothea turned to April and in her
eyes read the strain that well-nigh had broken her
cousin’s proud spirit.</p>

<p class='c012'>But a moment later both had jumped to their
feet in a feverish glow of hope. Two horses, not
one, were coming swiftly toward them and soon, galloping
around the bend in the road ahead, they saw
a single horseman followed, ten yards behind, by
another. In an instant they recognized Lee Hendon
in the lead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“April! April!” he shouted at the top of his
voice and in the tone were notes of happiness and
freedom.</p>

    <div>LOOSE ENDS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Charles Stewart had prophesied
many times that when the Union soldiers
came to little Washington they would
subject the people of the town to all sorts of humiliation
and suffering. And there were many who
shared this belief. But when these dreaded Yankees
appeared they took good care not to molest the citizens,
and Mrs. Stewart decided finally that for the
time being there was no need of her going to Brazil
or Mexico.</p>

<p class='c012'>With the Northern forces came a tall Union officer
who very shortly after his arrival went to call
at the Mays’. His visits were frequent, and in spite
of the fact that he was an enemy, all of the May family
came to have a respect for the quiet, gray-haired
man who looked so earnestly and with such a longing
gaze at Cousin Imogene. Dorothea had met him
early one afternoon, coming up the drive, and bowed
in acknowledgment of his salute as he reached her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am looking for Miss Imogene Ivory,” he said,
with a note of eagerness in his voice. “Will you
tell her please that General Stanchfield would be very
glad to see her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea made no effort to hide her surprise as
she looked up at the big soldier and he, looking down,
saw the question in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you wondering what has become of Larry?”
he asked with a smile. “I think you must be the
young lady who helped him to escape.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I did what I could,” Dorothea answered. “I
hope your son is safe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The General laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He isn’t my son, you know,” he replied.
“Larry’s my nephew, named after me, to be sure,
and some say he looks like me. What do you
think?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think he does,” Dorothea replied, a little embarrassed,
and then she took him to Miss Imogene,
with all sorts of romantic thoughts flying through her
mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some time after this Dorothea and Miss Imogene
were sitting on the porch alone, talking of this or
that, but usually coming back to the happy topic of
the war’s ending.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m so glad it’s over,” Miss Imogene said thankfully.
“Now the poor soldiers on both sides can
go home and lead peaceful lives and stop hating each
other. You know, honey,” she went on, “I could
never quite bring myself to hate the North. Perhaps
the General had something to do with that,”
she added, with the daintiest of blushes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s nice!” Dorothea declared. “But, Cousin
Imogene, there’s a mystery that I’ve never solved.
You know that Mr. Stanchfield, the General’s
nephew, I mean, thought there was a Red String in
this house. He was sure of it, in fact,—and so
was I.” She ended with a meaning look at her
cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you really think so still, Dorothea?” Miss
Imogene asked, looking up with a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I do,” Dorothea answered. “I’m sure of
it. At first I thought it was April, then I guessed it
was Val Tracy, then I suspected even Lucy,—but
now that the war’s over and it won’t make any difference
I think you’d better confess.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I, child! What do you mean?” demanded
Miss Imogene.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, aren’t you a Red String?” Dorothea questioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, my dear, of course I’m not,” Miss Imogene
replied positively and Dorothea looked blankly at her
for a moment or two, hardly able to believe her ears.
“How could I be? I am a Southern gentlewoman.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well!” the girl exclaimed finally, “if it wasn’t
you, who could it have been?”</p>

<p class='c012'>At that instant Harriot came out of the house and
stopped a moment beside them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m so hungry. Field peas and hominy and
bacon may fill you, but they aren’t food!” she sighed,
pushing back her hair, and Miss Imogene’s sharp
eyes saw a thin red string tied around one of her
young niece’s fingers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s that for, honey?” she asked, and Dorothea,
seeing the string, waited eagerly for the answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, that’s just a string,” Harriot answered.
“Aunt Decent wears one to keep the misery out of
her hands, and I thought I would see if it worked.
I never had any misery and I don’t want any.
But don’t you mention it to Aunt Decent. She’s
mighty touchy about it and doesn’t like any one to
notice it.” With that Harriot ran off again and left
the two gazing at each in surprised perplexity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Could it be Aunt Decent?” Dorothea whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It might be,” Miss Imogene replied. “That
old colored woman is a great power among the servants
and she could be of a great deal of help to any
one who needed it. I don’t know what to think, and
after all, honey, these Red Strings are very secret
and we’ll probably never know for sure. Perhaps
there wasn’t one about here at all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Stanchfield was so sure,” Dorothea began,
but here they were interrupted, and the subject was
dropped.</p>

<p class='c012'>That evening after Dorothea had gone to her
room for the night there came a gentle knock at the
door and she admitted Miss Imogene, who wore so
radiant a smile that Dorothea gave her a hug before
anything was said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t deserve it,” Miss Imogene whispered,
“but I shall be very happy. The General has asked
me to marry him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m so glad!” exclaimed Dorothea, nestling
close to the dear little lady. “And you do deserve
to be happy. You try to make every one happy
around you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s sweet of you, honey,” Miss Imogene murmured.
“I can only think of one more thing to
wish for. You remember young Larry Stanchfield,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To be sure,” Dorothea answered, drawing back
in her surprise. “I couldn’t forget him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad to hear you say that,” Miss Imogene
said quickly, “because, my dear, it would be so nice
if—” she hesitated an instant, “if some day you
were my niece instead of my cousin.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dorothea blushed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m afraid, Cousin Imogene, I can’t be that, unless—unless
you adopt Val Tracy for a nephew.
You see,” Dorothea went on hurriedly, “Val and I
were both mixed up. He thought I was in love with
Larry Stanchfield, and that’s the reason he saved
him that time, though an Irishman, of course, hates
an informer above anything. And I thought he was
in love with April; but he wasn’t, and—well, it all
came out that day we rescued Lee Hendon, and—and
I’m all mixed up, too, about what I’ll be when I
marry Val; because now I’m half English and half
American, and then I’ll be Irish too, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, my dear,” Miss Imogene replied as she took
the girl in her arms. “You’ll be all American, both
of you. Now that our country is to be united again
we can take in all the nationalities, and the Irish,
honey, make very good Americans! I think we’ll
have to arrange for a double wedding? What do
think?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think it would be lovely!” replied Dorothea.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c016'><i>Illustrated, $1.35</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The girls who have read and enjoyed the preceding Isabel
Carleton stories will be delighted to know that in this new
volume, Isabel’s life grows even more interesting, as she goes
on through the university. What happens in Jefferson, how the
war is brought home to Isabel and the story of two of her
friends in particular makes an absorbing narrative.</p>

<p class='c014'>Isabel Carleton has always been a lovable, straightforward,
human girl, and all of these qualities are heightened in the new
chronicle.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c016'><i>Illustrated, $1.35</i></div>

<p class='c014'>This book tells more of the delightful little girl who was the
central figure in a story published last year which has met with
the favor of thousands of young people.</p>

<p class='c014'>Elizabeth’s active interest in her “fambly” leads her to the
doing of unheard of things in their behalf. These experiences
and adventures, of which not the least appealing is that growing
out of her secret alliance with a fairy king who was to turn
stones into gold when his wand, which unfortunately was mislaid,
should be recovered, comprise a volume which is different
from the average child story.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is full of whimsical humor and of the sort of entertainment
which girls in their teens—and younger and older perhaps—find
most satisfying.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>By HAROLD S. LATHAM</div>
    <div>Illustrated by E C. Caswell</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c016'><i>$1.35</i></div>

<p class='c014'>This is a book that belongs decidedly to the American boy of
the present day. It is the story of Tim Scarsboro, a happy-go-lucky,
lovable lad who finds an outlet for his boundless energy
in the Pettibone Boys’ Club.</p>

<p class='c014'>How Tim and the other boys of this club go camping, get up
a minstrel, sell Thrift Stamps and do other patriotic work, as
well as have a “grand, glorious time” on numerous occasions
is described in a series of interesting chapters, culminating in a
scene of such life and spirit as will appeal to any American
lad.</p>

<p class='c014'>Incidentally, in “Under Orders,” the boys’ club movement gets
some of the credit that is due it for the good that it is doing in
building up the ideals of American youth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>By JOSEPH GOLLOMB</div>
    <div>With illustrations by E. C. Caswell</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c016'><i>$1.35</i></div>

<p class='c014'>This is a rousing story of public school life in a big city, a
story full of incidents ranging from hotly contested athletic
meets—baseball and basketball games—to mysterious secret society
initiations.</p>

<p class='c014'>The principal character is, perhaps, one J. Henley Smolett,
whose well-to-do father decrees that he shall go to the nearby
public school instead of to the aristocratic private institution on
which the boy’s heart had been set. There is a good reason for
the senior Smoletfs action, as the story shows. Hardly less
appealing as a character is Isadore Smolensky, of the East Side,
whose first encounter with J. Henley is of a pugilistic nature,
but who ultimately becomes his warm friend.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not only is the story vivid and exciting, but it gives, as well,
a mighty good idea of the democratizing process going on in
our public schools of to-day.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c016'><i>With many illustrations.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Every boy—and many a girl, too—likes to make things, and
it is out of this certain interest which youth has in invention
that this book has grown. Its appeal is primarily to the inventive
faculty latent in every youngster. Not only does Mr.
Darrow describe the great inventions of man, but he applies the
principles underlying them to simple apparatus which the boy
can construct for himself. The aëroplane, the balloon, the various
kinds of engines, the telephone, the telegraph, the submarine,
the telescope—all these and many more come in for consideration,
followed in each case with simple experiments which the
reader can make for himself, and in many cases with explicit
directions for the construction of an adaptation of the machine
or instrument.</p>

    <div>By MARGARET ASHMUN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c016'><i>Illustrated, $1.30</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Here’s a little boy, alone and friendless, in Last Chance Gulch.
His aunt, who was his only relative, has just died. The future
looks pretty dark to him—and that is where the story begins.</p>

<p class='c014'>What happens to Stephen after Emery and Sara Clark take
him back to their ranch out in the wildest part of Montana, how
he rides the bucking “Scratch Gravel,” helps to capture the bank
robbers, and how he saves Emery Clark’s life by doing a very
brave (and hard) thing, and best of all, how he takes his “last
chance,” is told in the most interesting and exciting way.</p>

<p class='c014'>Boys will like this book immensely because it is full of adventure
and something happens on every page. What happens?
Well—that’s telling!</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
